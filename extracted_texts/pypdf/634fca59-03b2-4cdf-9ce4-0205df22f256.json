D. \n \nArticle:  Reviewing the STEM Barrier  \nThe purpose of this research was to  investigate  the current state of access to journal papers in \nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. A comprehensive review  was \nconducted to explore the barriers that hinder equal and open access to STEM field knowledge. This \nstudy analyze d the impact of subscriptions, publication costs, and limited access on researchers, \nstudents, and general knowledge . It examine d the role of open access , preprint , and alternative \npublishing in diversity and inclusivity of knowledge. T his article provides  an over view of challeng es \nand suggests solutions for address ing the knowledge barrier in STEM fields  and the greater \nscientific community.  \n \nContribution s: \n- Designed t-test in R programming language  \n- Applied t-test for study data  synthesis \n \nMoore , A. was brought onto the research te am after the conceptualization and met hodology design \nof the study.  He was provided wit h annotated res earch data from previous research  and \ninvestigation , resources  with which to conduct his work, and financial support acquired  prior to his \nparticipation.  \nMoore, A. was supervised by the study  lead, who managed all research activity related to the study, \nvalidated the tests used by Moore, and provided Moore \u2019s data to the visualization  and writing \nteam.
