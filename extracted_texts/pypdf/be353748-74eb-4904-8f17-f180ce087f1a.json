In 1998, Congress passed an Act that extended the term of \nexisting copyrights by twenty years in the United States. This 1998 extension \nwas challenged by CC\u2019s founder, Lawrence Lessig, all the way to the Supreme \nCourt, but the Court upheld the Act. In reaction to this decision, a small group \nof lawyers, academics, and culture activists got together to try to make it easy , \nsimple, and free to share your works on the burgeoning communications plat -\nforms of the Internet.\nThey couldn\u2019t change copyright law, so they hacked it. Our founders created \na release valve, built on top of the international laws and treaties that govern \ncopyright.\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that no one knew just how successful the CC licenses \nwould be, or how much we would need them as we entered a world where every \nsingle person could be not only a creator, but also a creator of high-quality , \nreusable content. The seeds of Creative Commons were planted long before \nsocial media, before ubiquitous smartphones and broadband access, and before \nuser-generated content platforms. But these seeds set down an essential root \nin the open Internet, and offered a powerful tool used by individuals, govern -\nments, NGOs, and corporations to create, share, and remix content.\nToday , there are more than 1.6 billion CC-licensed works hosted on over 9 \nmillion websites\u2014including some of the most popular sites on the web. The CC \nlicenses operate in every country and have been translated into more than 30 \nlanguages by communities in more than 85 countries. They have been used to \nshare every type of content, from photos and videos to 3D models and datasets. Preface- viii -  Prefa Ce\nThe CC license tools are now the global standard for sharing of works for use \nand reuse. From Wikipedia , to open access to research and journals, to open \neducation, to open data, these license tools are an essential element of a more \nequitable and accessible knowledge commons.\nOur goal at Creative Commons is to build a vibrant, usable commons of cre -\nativity and knowledge, powered by collaboration and gratitude. By default, \ncopyright applies to all original content, so sharing under a copyright license \nis always a choice. This means we need to help people understand their options, \nand how they can use the CC licensing tools to maximum benefit. To do this, we \nneed people all around the world to be experts in using, contributing to, and \nsharing the commons and the open licensing tools that unlock its full potential. \nWe know that the best way to help others is to give them the knowledge they \nneed to help themselves. And we know that CC\u2019s greatest power is sharing\u2014of \nknowledge, of culture, and of understanding across cultures and communi -\nties\u2014so for the first time, we literally wrote the book on Creative Commons, and \nwe are sharing it with everyone. Creative Commons for Educators and Librarians \nis a publication of the CC Certificate course content. The CC Certificate is about \ninvesting in people like you: educators, practitioners, creators, open advocates, \nand activists all over the world. You\u2019re the ones who everyday help people make \nthe choice to share and unleash their content so that everyone can benefit from \nit. That\u2019s why we created the CC Certificate course, it\u2019s why we\u2019re working with \nour communities to translate the course content and train new leaders to teach \nit in local languages, and it\u2019s why we\u2019ve made all the content openly accessible \nunder CC BY\u2014to unlock new uses we haven\u2019t imagined yet.\nWe hope this book will help us get a little closer to that goal, and perhaps \nhelp us to grow the global community of experts, and ultimately our collective \npower, through shared knowledge and culture.\nRyan Merkley\nCEO, Creative Commons (2014  \u20132019)- ix -THE CREATIVE COMMONS CERTIFICATE CONTENT AND THIS PUBLICATION \nwe re  made possible by the generous support of the following foundations, and \nthe efforts of many partner organizations and individuals: \nWe gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation, the Samuel H.

The con -\ntent in this book and the information that Certificate facilitators share in the Cre -\native Commons course is also not legal advice. While you should not share legal \nadvice with others based on this book\u2019s content, you will develop a high level of expertise \nupon completion of this book. You will learn a lot about copyright, open licensing, and open \npractices in various communities. Upon finishing this book, you should feel comfortable \nsharing the facts about copyright and open licensing, case studies, and good open practices. !CREATIVE COMMONS IS A SET OF LEGAL TOOLS, A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION, \na global network and a movement\u2014all inspired by people\u2019s willingness to share \ntheir creativity and knowledge, and enabled by a set of open copyright licenses.\nCreative Commons began in response to an outdated global copyright \nlegal system. CC licenses are built on copyright and are designed to give more \noptions to creators who want to share. Over time, the role and value of Creative \nCommons have expanded. This chapter will introduce you to where Creative \nCommons came from and where it is headed.\nThis chapter has three sections:\n1. The Story of Creative Commons\n2. Creative Commons Today  \n3. Additional Resources- 2 -  CHaPter 1\n1.1  |   THE STORY OF CREATIVE COMMONS\nTo understand how a set of copyright licenses could inspire a global movement, \nyou need to know a bit about the origin of Creative Commons (CC). \nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Retell the story of why Creative Commons was founded\n\u2022 Identify the role of copyright law in the creation of Creative Commons \nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS \nWhat were the legal and cultural reasons for the founding of Creative Com -\nmons? Why has CC grown into a global movement?\nCreative Commons\u2019 founders recognized the mismatch between what tech -\nnology enables and what copyright restricts, and in response they have pro -\nvided an alternative approach for creators who want to share their work with \nothers. Today this approach is used by millions of creators around the globe. \nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nWhen did you first learn about Creative Commons? Think about how you would \narticulate what CC is to someone who has never heard of it. To fully understand \nthe organization, it helps to start with a bit of history . \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nThe story of Creative Commons begins with copyright. You\u2019ll learn a lot more \nabout copyright later in this book, but for now it\u2019s enough to know that copy -\nright is an area of law that regulates the way the products of human creativ -\nity are used\u2014products like books, academic research articles, music, and art. \nCopyright grants a set of exclusive rights to a creator, so that the creator has the \nability to prevent others from copying and adapting their work for a limited \ntime. In other words, copyright law strictly regulates who is allowed to copy \nand share with whom. \nThe Internet has given us the opportunity to access, share, and collaborate \non human creations (all governed by copyright) at an unprecedented scale. But \nthe sharing capabilities made possible by digital technology are in tension with \nthe sharing restrictions embedded within copyright laws around the world.\nCreative Commons was created to help address the tension between cre -\nators\u2019 ability to share digital works globally and copyright regulation. The story \nbegins with a particular piece of copyright legislation in the United States. It WH at Is CreatIve Commons?  - 3 -\nFIGURE 1.1  Larry Lessig giving \n#CCSummit2011 keynote\nPhoto from Flickr: flickr.com/photos/\ndtkindler/6155457139/\nAuthor: DTKindler   |  CC BY 2.0\nDesaturated from original\nwas called the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), and it was \nenacted in 1998. This Act extended the term of copyright protection for every \nwork in the United States\u2014even those already published\u2014for an additional 20 \nyears, so that the copyright term equaled the life of the creator plus 70 years. \n(This move put the U.S. copyright term in line with some other countries, \nthough the term in many more countries remains at 50 years after the creator\u2019s \ndeath to this day .) \n(Fun fact: The CTEA was commonly referred to as the Mickey Mouse Protec -\ntion Act because the extension came just before the original Mickey Mouse \ncartoon, Steamboat Willie , would have fallen into the public domain.)\nStanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig  (figure 1.1) believed that \nthis new law was unconstitutional. The term of copyright had been continually \nextended over the years. The end of a copyright term is important\u2014it marks the \nmoment when a work moves into the public domain, whereupon everyone can \nuse that work for any purpose without permission. This is a critical part of the \nequation in the copyright system. All creativity and knowledge build on what \ncame before, and the end of a copyright term ensures that copyrighted works \neventually move into the public domain and thus join the pool of knowledge and \ncreativity from which we can all freely draw to create new works. \nThe 1998 law was also hard to align with the purpose of copyright as it is \nwritten into the U.S. Constitution\u2014to create an incentive for authors to share \ntheir works by granting them a lim -\nited monopoly over them.  How could \nthe law possibly further incentivize \nsharing works that already existed? \nLessig represented a web pub -\nlisher, Eric Eldred, who had made a \ncareer of making works available as \nthey passed into the public domain. \nTogether, they challenged the consti -- 4 -  CHaPter 1\ntutionality of the Act. The case, known as Eldred vs. Ashcroft , went all the way to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. Eldred lost , and the Act was upheld. \nEnter Creative Commons\nInspired by the value of Eldred\u2019s goal of making more creative works freely \navailable on the Internet, and in response to a growing community of bloggers \nwho were creating, remixing, and sharing content, Lessig and others came up \nwith an idea. They created a nonprofit organization called Creative Commons \nand, in 2002, they published the Creative Commons licenses\u2014a set of free, \npublic licenses that would allow creators to keep their copyrights while shar -\ning their works on more flexible terms than the default \u201call rights reserved\u201d \napproach. Copyright is automatic, whether you want it or not; the moment an \noriginal work is fixed in tangible form, it is protected by copyright. And while \nsome people want to reserve all of the rights to their works, many others want \nto share their works with the public more freely . The idea behind CC licensing \nwas to create an easy way for creators who wanted to share their works in ways \nthat were consistent with copyright law. \nFrom the start, Creative Commons licenses were intended to be used by cre -\nators all over the world. The CC founders were initially motivated by a piece \nof U.S. copyright legislation, but similar copyright laws all over the world \nrestricted how our shared culture and collective knowledge could be used, even \nwhile digital technologies and the Internet have opened new ways for people \nto participate in culture and knowledge production. Since Creative Commons \nwas founded, much has changed in the way people share and how the Internet \noperates. In many places around the world, the restrictions on using creative \nworks have increased. Yet sharing and remix are now the norm online. Think \nabout your favorite video mashup, or even the photos your friend posted on \nsocial media last week. Sometimes these types of sharing and remix happen in \nviolation of copyright law, and sometimes they happen within social media net -\nworks that don\u2019t allow those works to be shared on other parts of the web. \nWatch the short video A Shared Culture  by Jesse Dylan to get a \nsense for the vision behind Creative Commons.  https://creative  \ncommons.org/about/videos/a-shared-culture   |  CC BY-NC-SA 3.0WH at Is CreatIve Commons?  - 5 -\nFIGURE 1.2  Growth in the number of Creative Commons-licensed works worldwide \nIn domains like textbook publishing, academic research, documentary film -\nmaking, and many other fields, restrictive copyright rules continue to inhibit \nthe creation, access, and remix of works. CC tools are helping to solve this prob -\nlem. In 2017 , CC licenses were used by more than 1.4 billion works online across \n9 million websites (figure 1.2); since 2017 , the number of CC-licensed works has \nincreased to over 1.6 billion. The grand experiment that started more than fif -\nteen years ago has been a success, sometimes in ways that were unimagined \nby CC\u2019s founders. (For more information, see the \u201cState of the Commons\u201d at the \nCreative Commons website: https://stateof.creative commons.org.) While other \ncustom open copyright licenses have been developed in the past, we recom -\nmend using Creative Commons licenses because they are up-to-date, free to use, \nand have been broadly adopted by governments, institutions, and individuals \nas the global standard for open copyright licenses.\nIn the next section, you\u2019ll learn more about what Creative Commons looks \nlike today\u2014the licenses, the organization, and the movement. \nFinal Remarks\nTechnology now makes it possible for online content to be consumed by mil -\nlions of people at once, and it can be copied, shared, and remixed with speed and - 6 -  CHaPter 1\nease. But copyright law places limits on our ability to take advantage of these \npossibilities. Creative Commons was founded to help us realize the full poten -\ntial of the Internet. \n1.2  |   CREATIVE COMMONS TODAY\nAs a set of legal tools, a nonprofit organization, and a global network and move -\nment, Creative Commons has evolved in many ways over the course of its history . \nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Diff erentiate between Creative Commons as a set of licenses, a movement, \nand a nonprofit organization \n\u2022 Explain the role of the CC Global Network \n\u2022 Describe the basic areas of work for Creative Commons as a nonprofit \norganizati on\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS \nNow we know why Creative Commons was started. But what is Creative Com -\nmons today? \nToday CC licenses are prevalent across the web and are used by creators \naround the world for every type of content you can imagine. The open move -\nment, which extends beyond just CC licenses, is a global force of people commit -\nted to the idea that the world is better when we share and work together. Cre -\native Commons is the nonprofit organization that stewards the CC licenses and \nhelps support the open movement. \nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nWhen you think about Creative Commons, do you think about its licenses? Or \nabout activists seeking copyright reform? A useful tool for sharing? Symbols in \ncircles? Something else? \nIn addition to giving creators more choices for how to share their \nwork, CC legal tools serve important policy goals in fields like \nscholarly publishing and education. Watch the brief video Why \nOpen Education Matters to get a sense of the opportunities that \nCC licenses create for education.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJWbVt  \n2Nc-I    |  CC BY 3.0WH at Is CreatIve Commons?  - 7 -\nAre you involved with Creative Commons as a creator, a reuser, or an advo -\ncate? Would you like to be one of these? \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nToday , the CC licenses and public domain tools are used on more than 1.6 billion \nworks, from songs to YouTube videos to scientific research. The licenses have \nhelped a global movement come together around openness, collaboration, and \nshared human creativity . Creative Commons, the nonprofit organization, was \nonce housed within the basement of the Stanford Law School, but now has a staff \nworking around the world on a host of different projects in various domains. \nWe\u2019ll take these different aspects of Creative Commons\u2014the legal tools, the \nmovement, and the organization\u2014and look at each in turn. \nCC LICENSES\nCC licenses are legal tools that function as an alternative for creators who \nchoose to share their works with the public under more permissive terms than \nthe default \u201call rights reserved\u201d approach under copyright. These legal tools \nare integrated into user-generated content platforms like YouTube, Flickr, and \nJamendo, and they are used by nonprofit open projects like Wikipedia  and Open -\nStax. They are also used by formal institutions like the Metropolitan Museum \nof Art  and Europeana , and by millions of individual creators. \nCollectively , the CC legal tools help create a global commons of diverse types \nof content that is freely availabl e for anyone to use. CC licenses may addition -\nally serve a non-copyright function. In communities of shared practices, the \nlicenses act to signal a set of values and a different way of operating. \nFor some users, this means looking back to the economic model of the com -\nmons. As the economist David Bollier describes it, \u201ca commons arises whenever \na given community decides it wishes to manage a resource in a collective man -\nner, with special regard for equitable access, use and sustainability. \u201d1  Wikipedia \nis a good example of a commons-based community around CC-licensed content. \nFor a creative take on Creative Commons and copyright, listen  \nto this song  by Jonathan \u201cSong-A-Day\u201d Mann about his choice to \nuse CC licenses for his music in Won\u2019t Lock It Down.  https://www  \n.youtube.com/watch?v=NUGP-oW4_ZE   |  CC BY 3.0- 8 -  CHaPter 1\nFor others, the CC legal tools and their icons express an affinity for a set of \ncore values. CC icons have become ubiquitous symbols for sharing, openness, \nand human collaboration. The CC logo and icons are now part of the permanent \ndesign collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City . \nWhile there is no single motivation for using CC licenses, there is a basic \nsense that CC licensing is rooted in a fundamental belief that knowledge and cre -\nativity are the building blocks of our culture rather than simple commodities \nfrom which to extract market value. The licenses reflect a belief that everyone \nhas something to contribute, and that no one can own our shared culture. Fun -\ndamentally , the licenses reflect a belief in the promise and benefits of sharing.\nTHE MOVEMENT\nSince 2001, a global coalition of people has formed around Creative Commons \nand open licensing.2 This includes activists working on copyright reform \naround the globe; policy-makers advancing policies that mandate open access \nto publicly funded educational resources, research, and data; and creators who \nshare a core set of values. In fact, most of the people and institutions that are \npart of the CC movement are not formally connected to Creative Commons.\nCreative Commons has a formal CC Global Network,3 which includes lawyers, \nactivists, scholars, artists, and more, all working on a wide range of projects and \nissues connected to sharing and collaboration. But the CC Global Network is just \none player in the larger open movement, which includes Wikipedians, Mozil -\nlians, open access advocates, and many more. \nOpen source software is cited as the first domain where networked open \nsharing produced a tangible benefit as a movement that went much further than \ntechnology . The Conversation website\u2019s Explainer summarizes other move -\nments (http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-the-open-movement-10308) \nadds other examples, such as Open Innovation in the corporate world, Open \nData (see the Open Data Commons at https://opendatacommons.org), and \nCrowdsourcing. There is also the Open Access movement, which aims to make \nresearch widely available; the Open Science movement; and the growing move -\nment around Open Educational Resources.\nCREATIVE COMMONS: THE ORGANIZATION\nCreative Commons is a small nonprofit organization that stewards the CC legal \ntools and helps power the open movement. Creative Commons is a distributed \norganization, with CC staff and contractors working around the world. WH at Is CreatIve Commons?  - 9 -\nIn 2016, Creative Commons embarked on a new organizational strategy \nbased on building and sustaining a vibrant, usable commons, powered by col -\nlaboration and gratitude.4 This is a shift from focusing only on the number of \nworks out there under CC licenses and available for reuse, to a new emphasis on \nthe connections and collaborations which happen around that content.\nGuided by that strategy , Creative Commons\u2019 organizational work loosely \nfalls into two main buckets: \n\u2022 Licenses, tools, and technology: The CC licenses and public domain tools \nare the core legal tools designed and stewarded by Creative Commons. \nWhile our licenses have been rigorously vetted by legal experts around \nthe globe, our work is still not done. We are actively working on technical \ninfrastructure designed to make it easier to find and use all the content in \nthe digital commons. We are also thinking about ways to better adapt all \nof Creative Commons\u2019 legal and technical tools for today\u2019s web. \n\u2022 Supporting the movement:  Creative Commons works to help people within \nopen movements collaborate on projects and work toward similar goals. \nThrough CC\u2019s multiple programs, we work directly with our global com -\nmunity\u2014across education, culture, science, copyright reform, govern -\nment policy , and other sectors\u2014to help train and empower open advo -\ncates around the world. \nFinal Remarks\nCreative Commons has grown from its home in a law school basement into a \nglobal organization with a wide reach and a well-known name associated with \na core set of shared values. It is, at one and the same time, a set of licenses, a \nmovement, and a nonprofit organization.

THEY ARE BUILT \non top of it. The default of \u201call rights reserved\u201d copyright means that all rights \nto copy and adapt a work are reserved by the author or creator (with some \nimportant exceptions that you will learn about shortly). By contrast, Creative \nCommons licenses adopt a \u201csome rights reserved\u201d approach, enabling authors \nor creators to free up their works for reuse by the public under certain condi -\ntions. To understand how Creative Commons licenses work, it is important that \nyou have a basic understanding of copyright.\nThis chapter has five sections: \n1. Copyright Basics\n2. Global Aspects of Copyright\n3. The Public Domain\n4. Exceptions and Limitations of Copyright\n5. Additional Resources\nThis chapter is important because Creative Commons licenses and public \ndomain tools depend on copyright in order to work. While some aspects of \ncopyright law have been harmonized around the world, the laws of copyright \ngenerally vary\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014from country to country . The infor -\nmation contained in this chapter is not intended to be exhaustive or to cover all \naspects of the complex laws of copyright around the world, or even every aspect \nof copyright that may impact how the CC licenses operate in a particular situ -\n2\nCopyright Law- 14 -  CHaPter 2\nation. It is intended to provide an overview of the basic concepts that are most \nimportant for an understanding of how Creative Commons licenses operate. \n2.1  |   COPYRIGHT BASICS\nIs copyright confusing to you? Let\u2019s get some clarity by understanding its his -\ntory and purpose.\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS    \nWhy do we have laws that restrict the copying and sharing of creative work? \n(Note: A \u201ccreative work\u201d can be anything that is an original work. These can \nrange from novels, poems, and plays to movies, TV shows, and videos; to songs \nand other musical compositions; to paintings, drawings, and sculptures; to all \nsorts of books, articles, and essays; computer programs; cartoons and comic \nbooks; and even the drawings our children make and our own jottings on a nap -\nkin. Anything we write, film, or record is a \u201ccreative work\u201d as long as it is an \noriginal product and is fixed in a tangible form or medium.) And how do laws \nthat restrict the copying of creative work function in the context of the Internet, \nwhere nearly everything we do involves making a copy? \nCopyright law is an important area of law, one that reaches into nearly \nevery facet of our lives, whether we know it or not. Aspects of our lives that in \nsome instances are not regulated by copyright\u2014like reading a physical book\u2014\nbecome regulated by copyright when technology is used to share the same book \nby posting it to the Internet. Because almost everything we do online involves \nmaking a copy , copyright has become a regular feature in our lives. \nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Trace the basic history of copyright\n\u2022 Explain the purpose of copyright\n\u2022 Explain how copyright is automatic\n\u2022 Explain general copyright terms\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nThink back to a time when you invested significant effort in a creative project. \nWhat was your motivation for doing so? Did you know at the time that you were \ncreating a work which is very likely protected by copyright, which restricts \nmost reuses of that work by others without your permission? Did knowing that, \nor would knowing that, have made a difference to you? If so, why?CoPyrI gHt La W  - 15 -\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nYou might not realize it, but copyright law is as integral to your daily life as \nlocal traffic laws. Copyright law is the area of law that limits how others may \nuse the original works of authors (or creators, as we often call them)\u2014works \nspanning the spectrum from novels and operas, to cat videos, to scribbles on a \nnapkin.\nAlthough copyright laws vary from country to country , there are certain \ncommonalities among these laws globally . This is largely due to international \ntreaties. These treaties are explained in detail in section 2.2 \u201cGlobal Aspects of \nCopyright. \u201d \nThere are some important fundamentals you need to be aware of regarding \nwhat is copyrightable, as well as who controls the rights and can grant permis -\nsion to reuse a copyrighted work.\n1. Copyright grants a set of exclusive rights to  creators , which means that \nno one else can copy , distribute, perform, adapt, or otherwise use their \nwork in violation of those exclusive rights. This gives creators the means \nto control the use of their works by others, thereby incentivizing them \nto create new works in the first place. The person who controls the rights , \nhowever, may not always be the author. It is important to understand \nwho controls the exclusive rights granted by copyright in order to under -\nstand who has authority to grant permissions to others to reuse the work \n(e.g., by adding a CC license to the work). For example:\n\u2022 Work created in the course of your employment may be subject to \ndiffering degrees of employer ownership based on your jurisdiction. \nAustralia, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States adhere \nto some form of a doctrine commonly known as \u201cwork for hire. \u201d This \ndoctrine generally provides that if you have created a copyrightable \nwork within the scope of your employment, the employer is the \nowner of, and controls the economic rights in the copyrighted work, \neven though you are the author and may retain your moral rights.\n\u2022 Independent contractors may or may not own and control copyright \nin the works they create in that capacity\u2014this determination almost \nalways depends on the terms of the contract between you and the \norganization that engaged you to perform the work, even though \nyou are the author and may have moral rights.\n\u2022 Teachers, university faculty , and learners may or may not own and \ncontrol copyright in the works they create in those capacities\u2014that - 16 -  CHaPter 2\ndetermination will depend on certain laws (such as work for hire in \nsome instances) and on the terms of the employment or contractor \nagreement, university or school policies, and terms of enrollment \nat the particular institution, even though they are the creators and \nmay have moral rights.\n\u2022 If you have co-created an original work that is subject to copyright, \nyou may be a joint owner, not an exclusive owner, of the rights \ngranted by copyright law. Joint ownership generally allows all \nowners to exercise the exclusive rights granted by law, but requires \nthe owners to be accountable to one another for certain uses they \nmake of their joint work.\n\u2022 Ownership and control of the rights afforded by copyright laws \nare co mplicated. For more information, please see the \u201cA dditional \nResources \u201d section at the end of this chapter.\n2. Copyright does not protect facts or ideas  themselves, only the expression \nof those facts or ideas. This may sound simple, but unfortunately it is \nnot. The difference between an idea  and the expression  of that idea can \nbe tricky , but it\u2019s also extremely important to understand. While copy -\nright law gives creators control over the expression of an idea, it does not \nallow the copyright holder to own or exclusively control the idea itself.  \n3. As a general rule, copyright is automatic  the moment a work is fixed in a \ntangible medium. For example, you have a copyright as soon as you type \nthe first stanza of your poem or record a song in most countries. Regis -\ntering your copyright with a local copyright \nauthority allows you to officially record your \nauthorship, and in some countries this may be \nnecessary to enforce your rights or might pro -\nvide you with certain other advantages. But \ngenerally speaking, you do not have to register \nyour work to become a copyright holder.\n4. Copyright protection lasts a long time . We \nwill say more about this later, but for now it\u2019s \nenough to know that copyright lasts a long time, \noften many decades after the creator dies.NOTE The combi -\nnation of very long \nterms of copyright pro -\ntection with automatic \nentry into the copyright \nsystem has created \na massive amount of \n\u201corphan works\u201d\u2014copy -\nrighted works for which \nthe copyright holder is \nunknown or impossible \nto locate. !CoPyrI gHt La W  - 17 -\nA SIMPLE HISTORY OF COPYRIGHT\nArguably , the world\u2019s most important early copyright law was enacted in 1710 \nin England: the Statute of Anne , \u201cAn act for the encouragement of learning, by \nvesting the copies of printed books in the authors or purchasers of such copies, \nduring the times therein mentioned. \u201d1 This law gave book publishers fourteen \nyears of legal protection from the copying of their books by others.\nSince then, the scope of the exclusive rights granted under copyright has \nexpanded. Today, copyright law extends far beyond books to cover nearly any -\nthing with even a fragment of creativity or originality created by humans.\nAdditionally , the duration of the exclusive rights has also expanded. Today, \nin many parts of the world, the term of copyright granted an individual creator \nis the life of the creator plus an additional fifty years. See the \u201cWorldwide Map \nof Copyright Term Length\u201d (figure 2.3) in section 2.2 \u201cGlobal Aspects of Copy -\nright\u201d (below) for more details about the duration of copyright and its vari -\nances worldwide.\nAnd finally , since the Statute of Anne, copyright treaties have been signed \nby many countries. The result is that copyright laws have been harmonized to \nsome degree around the world. You will learn more about the most important \ntreaties and how copyright laws work around the world in section 2.2.\nTHE PURPOSE OF COPYRIGHT\nThere are two primary rationales for copyright law, though rationales do vary \namong legal traditions. The two rationales are:\n\u2022 Utilitarian:  Under this rationale, copyright is designed to provide an \nincentive to creators. The aim is to encourage the creation of new works.\n\u2022 Author\u2019s rights:  Under this rationale, copyright is primarily intended \nto ensure attribution for authors and preserve the integrity of cre -\native works. The aim is to recognize and protect the deep connection \nthat authors have with their creative works. (You can learn more about \nauthor\u2019s rights in the \u201cAdditional Resources\u201d section at the end of this \nchapter.)\nWhile different legal systems identify more strongly with one or the other of \nthese rationales, or have other justifications particular to their legal traditions, \nmany copyright systems are influenced by and draw from both rationales (due, \nin large part, to historical reasons that are outside the scope of this material). - 18 -  CHaPter 2\nDo one or both of these justifications resonate with you? What other reasons \ndo you believe support or don\u2019t support the granting of exclusive rights to the \ncreators of original works?\nDrawing on the author\u2019s rights tradition, most countries also have moral \nrights that protect, sometimes indefinitely , the bond between authors and their \ncreative output. Moral rights are distinct from the rights granted to copyright \nholders to restrict others from economically exploiting their works, but they \nare closely connected.\nThe two most common types of moral rights are the right to be recognized as \nthe author of the work  (known traditionally as the \u201cright of paternity\u201d) and the \nright to protect the work\u2019s integrity  (generally , the right to object to distortion of \nor the introduction of undesired changes to the work).\nNot all countries have moral rights, but in some parts of the world they are \nconsidered so integral that they cannot be licensed away or waived by creators, \nand they last indefinitely . \nHOW COPYRIGHT WORKS: A PRIMER \nCopyright applies to works of original authorship, which means works that are \nunique and not a copy of someone else\u2019s work, and most of the time this requires \nthe works\u2019 fixation in a tangible medium (written down, recorded, saved to your \ncomputer, etc.).\nCopyright law establishes the basic terms of use that apply automatically to \nthese original works. These terms give the creator or owner of copyright cer -\ntain exclusive rights, while also recognizing that users have certain rights to \nuse these works without the need for a license or permission.\nWhat\u2019s copyrightable?\nIn countries that have signed on to the major copyright treaties described in \nmore detail in section 2.2, copyright exists in the following general categories \nof works, though sometimes special rules apply on a country-by-country basis. \nA specific country\u2019s copyright laws almost always further specify different \nWatch  Copy (aka copyright) Tells the Story of His Life from  \n#FixCopyright for a short history of copyright and its relation  \nto creativity and sharing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fdU  \nDecJ6jc   |  CC BY 3.0CoPyrI gHt La W  - 19 -\ntypes of works within each category . Can you think of a type of work within \neach category? \n\u2022 Literary, artistic, musical, and dramatic works\n\u2022 Translations, adaptations, arrangements, and alterations of literary , \nartistic, and musical works\n\u2022 Collections of literary and artistic works2\n\u2022 Additionally , depending on the country, original works of authorship \nmay also include, among others:\n \u00bbApplied art and industrial designs and models \n \u00bbComputer software\nWhat are the exclusive rights granted?\nCreators who have copyright have exclusive rights to control certain uses of \ntheir works by others, such as the following (note that other rights may exist \ndepending on the country): \n\u2022 to make copies of their works\n\u2022 to publicly perform and communicate their works to the public, includ -\ning via broadcast\n\u2022 to make adaptations and arrangements of their works (Adaptations can \ninclude translations.)\nThis means that if you own the copyright to a particular book, no one else can \ncopy or adapt that book without your permission (with important caveats, \nwhich we will get to later in section 2.3 \u201cGlobal Aspects of Copyright\u201d). Keep in \nmind that there is an important difference between being the copyright holder \nof a novel and controlling how a particular authorized copy of the novel is used. \nWhile the copyright owner owns the exclusive rights to make copies of the novel, \nthe person who owns a particular physical copy of that novel can generally do \nwhat they want with it, such as loan it to a friend or sell it to a used bookstore.\nOne of the exclusive rights of copyright is the right to adapt a work. An adap -\ntation (or a \u201cderivative work, \u201d as it is sometimes called) is a new work based \non a preexisting work. In some countries, the term derivative work  is used to \ndescribe changes that include but are not limited to \u201cadaptations\u201d as described \nin the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, \nwhich uses both of these terms in different articles. For the purposes of this \nbook and for understanding how CC licenses and public domain tools work, the \nterms derivative work  and adaptation  are interchangeable and denote a work - 20 -  CHaPter 2\nthat has been created from a preexisting work through changes that can only be \nmade with the permission of the copyright holder. It is important to note that \nnot all changes to an existing work require permission. Generally , a modifica -\ntion rises to the level of an adaptation or derivative when the modified work \nis based on the prior work and manifests sufficient new creativity to be copy -\nrightable, such as a translation of a novel from one language to another, or the \ncreation of a screenplay based on a novel.\nCopyright owners often grant permission to others to adapt their work. \nAdaptations are entitled to their own copyright, but that protection only \napplies to the new elements that are particular to the adaptation. For example, \nif the author of a poem gives someone permission to make an adaptation, that \nperson may rearrange stanzas, add new stanzas, and change some of the word -\ning, among other things. Generally , the original author retains all copyright in \nthe elements of the poem that remain in the adaptation, and the person adapting \nthe poem has a copyright in their new contributions to the adapted poem. Cre -\nating a derivative work does not eliminate the copyright held by the creator of \nthe preexisting work.\nA special note about additional exclusive rights\nThere are two other categories of rights that are important to understand \nbecause the rights are licensed and referenced by Creative Commons licenses \nand public domain tools:\n\u2022 Moral rights:  As mentioned above, moral rights are an integral feature of \nmany countries\u2019 copyright laws. These rights are recognized in Article \n6bis of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic \nWorks\u2014described in more detail in section 2.2\u2014and are integrated in the \nlaws of all treaty signatories to some extent. Creative Commons licenses \nand legal tools account for these moral rights, and the reality is that they \ncannot be waived or licensed in many countries, even though other exclu -\nsive economic rights are waivable or licensable.\n\u2022 Similar and related rights  (including rights known in many countries as \n\u201cneighboring rights\u201d): Closely related to copyright are similar and related \nrights. These are rights that relate to copyrighted works and grant addi -\ntional exclusive rights beyond the basic rights granted authors that were \ndescribed above. Some of these rights are governed by international trea -\nties, but they also vary country by country . Generally, these rights are CoPyrI gHt La W  - 21 -\ndesigned to give some \u201ccopyright-like\u201d rights to those who are not them -\nselves the author but are involved in communicating the work to the public, \nfor example, broadcasters and performers. Some countries like Japan have \nestablished these rights as part of copyright itself, while other countries \ntreat these rights separately from, though closely related to, copyright.\n \u00bbThe term Similar Rights  is used to describe these similar and \nrelated rights in CC licenses and CC0, as you will learn in the next \nchapter in section 3.2.\n \u00bbAn in-depth discussion of these rights is beyond the scope of this \nunit. What is important to be aware of is that they exist, and that \nCreative Commons licenses and public domain tools cover these \nrights, thereby allowing those who have such rights to use CC tools \nto give the public permission to use works in ways that would oth -\nerwise violate those rights.\nDoes the public have any right to use copyrighted works that do not violate the \nexclusive rights of creators?\nAll countries that have signed on to major international treaties grant the public \nsome rights to use copyrighted works without permission, and without violat -\ning the exclusive rights given creators. These are generally called \u201cexceptions \nand limitations\u201d to copyright. Many countries itemize the specific exceptions \nand limitations on which the public may rely , while some countries have flex -\nible exceptions and limitations such as the concept of \u201cfair use\u201d in the United \nStates, \u201cfair dealing\u201d in some Commonwealth countries, and education-spe -\ncific exceptions and limitations in many other parts of the world, including \nthe Global South. Exploring these concepts in detail is reserved for section 2.4 \n\u201cExceptions and Limitations of Copyright. \u201d What is important to know is that \ncopyright law does not require permission from the creator for every use of \na copyrighted work\u2014some uses are permitted as a matter of copyright policy , \nwhich balances the sometimes competing interests of the copyright owner and \nthe public.\nWhat else should I know about copyright?\nAs noted at the beginning of this chapter, copyright is complex and varies \naround the world. This chapter serves as a general introduction to its central \nconcepts. There are some concepts, such as (1) liability and remedies, (2) licens -\ning and transfer, and (3) termination of copyright transfers and licenses, that - 22 -  CHaPter 2\nyou should be aware of because you are likely to encounter them at some point.  \nYou will find a comprehensive explanation of these concepts in the \u201cAdditional \nResources\u201d section at the end of this chapter.\nDistinguishing Copyright from Other Types  \nof Intellectual Property\nIntellectual property  is the term used for rights\u2014established by law\u2014that \nempower creators to restrict others from using their creative works. Copyright \nis one type of intellectual property , but there are many others. To help under -\nstand copyright, it is important to have a basic understanding of at least two \nother types of intellectual property rights and the laws that protect those rights.\n\u2022 Trademark law  generally protects the public from being confused about \nthe source of a good, service, or establishment. The holder of a trademark \nis generally allowed to prevent uses of its trademark by others if the pub -\nlic will be confused. Examples of trademarks are the golden arches used \nby McDonald\u2019s and the brand name Coca-Cola. Trademark law helps pro -\nducers of goods and services protect their reputation, and it protects the \npublic by giving them a simple way to differentiate between similar prod -\nucts and services.\n\u2022 Patent law  gives inventors a time-limited monopoly to their inventions\u2014\nthings like mousetraps or new mobile phone technology . Patents typically \ngive inventors the exclusive right to make, have made, use, have used, \noffer for sale, sell, have sold, or import patentable inventions.\nOther types of intellectual property rights include trade secrets, publicity \nrights, and moral rights, to give just a few examples. \nFinal Remarks\nDigital technology has made it easier than ever to copy and reuse works that \nothers have created, and it has made it easier than ever to create and share your \nown work. In short, copyright is everywhere.

Does it make sense to you that different people should \nhave different limits to what they can do with your work based on their geo -\ngraphic location? Why or why not? \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge:  \nIntroduction to the Global Copyright System\nINTERNATIONAL LAWS\nEvery country has its own copyright laws, but over the years there has been \nextensive global harmonization of copyright laws through treaties and multi -\nlateral and bilateral trade agreements. These treaties and agreements establish \nminimum standards for all participating countries, which then enact or amend \ntheir own laws in order to conform to the agreed-upon limits. This system \nleaves room for local variations.\nThese treaties and agreements are negotiated in various forums: the World \nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the World Trade Organization \n(WTO), and in private negotiations between countries.\nOne of the most significant international agreements on copyright law is \nthe Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (the \n\u201cBerne Convention\u201d), concluded in 1886. The Berne Convention has since been \nrevised and amended on several occasions. WIPO serves as the administrator \nof the treaty and its revisions and amendments, and is the depository for offi -\ncial instruments of accession to and ratification of the treaty . Today , 177 coun -\ntries (as of October 17 , 2019) have signed the Berne Convention. This treaty (as \namended and revised) lays out several fundamental principles upon which all \nthe participating countries have agreed. One of these principles is that copy -\nright must be granted automatically\u2014that is, there must be no legal formalities  \nrequired to obtain copyright protection (for example, the national laws of the \nsignatories cannot require you to register or pay for your copyright as a con -CoPyrI gHt La W  - 25 -\ndition for receiving copyright \nprotection). In general, the \nBerne Convention as revised \nand amended also requires \nthat all countries give foreign \nworks the same protection \nthey give to works created within their borders, assuming the other country \nis a signatory . Figure 2.2 is a map showing (in dark gray) the signatories to the \nBerne Convention as of 2012.\nAdditionally , the Berne Convention sets minimum standards\u2014default \nrules\u2014for the duration of copyright protection for creative works, though \nsome exceptions exist, depending on the subject matter. The Berne Con -\nvention\u2019s standards for copyright protection dictate a minimum term of \nthe life of the author plus 50 years. Because the Berne Convention sets mini -\nmums only, several countries have established longer  terms of copyright \nfor individual creators, such as \u201clife of the author plus 70 years\u201d or \u201clife of \nthe author plus 100 years. \u201d You can review the Wikipedia  article on \u201cCopy -\nright Term\u201d (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0, available at https://en.wikipedia.org/\nwiki/Copyright_term ) and view the page that lists the duration of copyright \nbased on country (also licensed CC BY-SA 3.0, available at https://en.wiki  \npedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths).  The map in figure 2.3 \nshows the status of copyright duration around the world as of 2012.\nIn addition to the Berne Convention, several other international agreements \nhave further harmonized copyright rules around the world.3FIGURE 2.2  World map showing the parties \nto the Berne convention, 2012 \nThe signatories of the Berne Convention for the \nProtection of Literary and Artistic Works, as of 2012 \nFigure from Wikimedia Commons: https://commons  \n.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berne_Convention.png\nCC BY-SA  3.0  |  Desaturated from original- 26 -  CHaPter 2\nNATIONAL LAWS\nAlthough an international framework exists because of the Berne Conven -\ntion and other treaties and agreements, copyright law is actually enacted and \nenforced through national laws. Those laws are supported by national copy -\nright offices, which in turn support copyright holders, allow for registration, \nand provide interpretative guidance. As mentioned, while there has been \na major effort to create minimum standards for copyright across the globe, \ncountries still have a significant amount of discretion as to how they meet the \nrequirements imposed by the various treaties and agreements. This means that \nthe details of copyright law still vary quite a bit from country to country .\nWhich nation\u2019s law applies to my use of a work restricted by copyright? \nA common question of copyright creators and users of their works is which \nnation\u2019s copyright law applies to a particular use of a particular work. Gener -\nally , the rule of territoriality applies: national laws are limited in their reach \nto activities taking place within that country . This also means that generally \nspeaking, the law of the country where a work is used  applies to that particular \nFIGURE 2.3   Worldwide map of copyright term length\nFigure from Wikimedia Commons: https://commons  \n.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:World_copyright_terms.svg\nAuthor: Balfour Smith, Canuckguy, Badseed, Martsniez\nOriginal image by Balfour Smith at Duke University\nCC BY 3.0  |  Desaturated from original\nCoPyrI gHt La W  - 27 -\nFIGURE 2.4   \nA still from the 1902 film   \nLe Voyage dans la Lune   \n(A Trip to the Moon ) \nImage from Wikimedia Commons: \nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/\nwiki/File:Melies_color_Voyage  \n_dans_la_lune.jpg\nAuthor: Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s  \nA work in the public domainuse. If you are distributing a book in a particular country , then the law of the \ncountry where you are distributing the book generally applies. \nThis is true even in the era of the Internet, though it is much harder to apply. \nFor example, if you are a Canadian citizen traveling to Germany and using a \ncopyrighted work in your PowerPoint presentation, then German copyright \nlaw normally applies to your use. \nIt can be complicated to determine which national law applies in any given \ncase. This complexity is one of the benefits of Creative Commons licenses, which \nare designed to be enforceable everywhere.\nFinal Remarks\nEven though global copyright treaties and agreements exist, there is no one \n\u201cinternational copyright law. \u201d Different countries have different standards for \nwhat is protected by copyright, how long copyright lasts and what it restricts, \nand what penalties apply when it is infringed.\n2.3  |   THE PUBLIC DOMAIN \nThe \u201cpublic domain\u201d consists of creative works that are not subject to copy -\nright. This is the enormous pool of publicly available material which circulates \nfreely , and from which new creative works and knowledge may be built. Figure \n2.4 shows a still from the 1902 French film Le Voyage dans la lune  (A Trip to the  \nMoon ), which is now in the public domain.- 28 -  CHaPter 2\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Explain what the public domain is\n\u2022 Communicate the value of the public domain\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nWhy is it important that works eventually fall out of copyright? Are there any \nworks that do not qualify for copyright protection and may be freely used? \nA critical aspect of copyright law is that the protection it provides does not \nlast forever. After a set term, the copyright expires and the work enters the pub -\nlic domain for everyone to copy , adapt, and share. Likewise, there are certain \ntypes of works that fall outside the scope of copyright. \nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nHave you ever seen ancient Egyptian sculptures in real life? Have you ever lis -\ntened to a Beethoven symphony? Have you ever read Tolstoy\u2019s novel War and \nPeace ? These works are in the public domain. What other public domain works \nhave you enjoyed in your lifetime? Have you ever created something new using \na work in the public domain? \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nDespite the expansive reach of copyright, there is still a rich (and growing) pub -\nlic domain full of works which are free from copyright. Works enter the public \ndomain in one of four ways: \n1. The copyright expires.\nWhile copyright terms are longer than ever before, they are not in fi-\nnite. In most countries, the term of an individual\u2019s copyright expires \n50 years after her death. In some countries, the term is longer and can \nbe up to 100 years after the author dies. Review the map in figure 2.3 \n(earlier in this chapter) for an overview of copyright terms around  \nthe world.\n2. The work was never entitled to copyright protection.\nCopyright covers vast amounts of content cre -\nated by authors, but certain categories of works \nfall outside the scope of copyright. For example, \nworks that are purely functional are not copy -\nrightable, like the design of a screw. The Berne \nConvention identifies additional categories that NOTE  Moral \nrights may \ncontinue to exist \nin works that have \notherwise entered \nthe public domain. \nSee section 2.1 \n\u201cCopyright Basics.\u201d!CoPyrI gHt La W  - 29 -\ncannot be copyrighted, such as official texts of a legislative, admin -\nistrative, and legal nature. Furthermore, in some countries, works \ncreated by government employees are excluded from copyright pro -\ntection and are not eligible for copyright. Facts and ideas are never \ncopyrightable.\n3. The creator dedicates the work to the public domain before its copyright has \nexpired.\nIn most parts of the world, a creator can decide to forego the protec -\ntions of copyright and dedicate their work to the public domain. Cre -\native Commons has a legal tool called CC0 (\u201cCC Zero\u201d)  Public Domain \nDedication that helps authors put their works into the worldwide pub -\nlic domain to the greatest extent possible. You\u2019ll learn more about this \ntool (and other Creative Commons legal tools) later in this book. \n4. The copyright holder failed to comply with the formalities required to \nacquire or maintain their copyright.\nToday in most countries, there are no formal requirements to acquire \nor renew copyright protection over a work. This was not always the \ncase, however, and many works have entered the public domain over \nthe years because a creator failed to adhere to these formalities. \nWHAT CAN YOU DO WITH A WORK THAT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN?\nYou can do almost anything, but it depends on the scope and duration of copy -\nright protection in the particular country where the work is used. Depending \non the country , for example, a work in the public domain may still be covered \nby moral rights that last beyond the duration of copyright. It\u2019s also possible that \na work is in the public domain in one country but is still under copyright in \nanother country. This means you may not be able to use the work freely where \ncopyright still applies.\nFIGURE 2.5  Creative Commons CC0 Icon\nThe CC icons are visual symbols that convey \nthe basic permissions associated with a par -\nticular type of CC license or tool.\nAvailable for download at https://\ncreativecommons.org/about/downloads- 30 -  CHaPter 2\nAUTHOR CREDIT AND THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\nEven though it may not be legally required in every country , and especially \nin those countries where moral rights do not exist after the term of copyright \nexpires, there are many benefits to identifying and giving credit to the origi -\nnal creator s, even after their work has entered the public domain. Many com -\nmunities have adopted norms, which are accepted standards for crediting the \nauthors and the treatment of works in the public domain. Creative Commons \nhas created public domain guidelines that can be used by communities to create \ntheir own norms. You can review the CC guidelines at https://wiki.creativecom -\nmons.org/wiki/Public_Domain_Guidelines. Can you think of a reason why it \nmight be helpful to give credit to an author whose work is in the public domain? \nCan you think of why norms should be encouraged when public domain works \nare reused?\nFINDING WORKS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN\nWith millions of creative works whose copyright has expired\u2014and many more \nadded regularly with tools like the CC0 Public Domain Dedication\u2014the public \ndomain is a vast treasure trove of content. \nAmong the sites that host works in the public domain are Project Gutenberg, \nPublic Domain Review, Digital Public Library of America, Wikimedia Com -\nmons, Internet Archive, Library of Congress, Flickr, and the Rijksmuseum. The \nCC Search tool ( https://search.creativecommons.org/ ) is another way to find \npublic domain material.  \nIt is not always easy to identify whether a work is in the public domain \n(though there are many resources available to help). As we learned, copyright \nprotection is automatic, so the absence of the copyright symbol \u201c \u00a9\u201d does not \nmean a work is in the public domain. In addition to its CC0 Public Domain \nDedication for creators, Creative Commons also has a tool called the Public \nNOTE   A work that is in the public domain for purposes of copyright law may still \nbe subject to other intellectual property restrictions. For example, a story that \nis in the public domain may have a trademarked brand on the cover associated \nwith the publisher of the book. Trademark protection is independent of copyright \nprotection and may still exist even though the work is in the public domain as a matter of \ncopyright. Also, once a creator uses a public domain work to turn it into a new work, the \ncreator will have copyright on the portions of their new work that are original to them. As \nan example, the creator of a film adaptation based on a novel in the public domain will have \ncopyright protection over the film, but not the underlying novel. !CoPyrI gHt La W  - 31 -\nDomain Mark ( https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/\npdm ), which is designed to label works whose copyright has expired every -\nwhere in the world, so that reusers can easily identify those works as being in \nthe worldwide public domain. As of 2016, CC\u2019s public domain tools were used \non more than 90 million works.  \nFinal Remarks\nA healthy public domain is crucial to preserving our cultural heritage, inspir -\ning new generations of creators, and increasing human knowledge. Because \nthe scope and duration of copyright have grown so much over the years, it can \nbe easy to forget that the public domain exists at all. But the public domain is \na critical part of the bargain of copyright and works in the public domain are \nincredible resources that belong to all of us. \n2.4  |   EXCEPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TO COPYRIGHT\nThe limitations and exceptions built into copyright, including \u201cfair use\u201d and \n\u201cfair dealing\u201d in some parts of the world, were designed to ensure that the \nrights of the public were not unduly restricted by copyright.\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nWhat would the world look like if copyright had no limits to what it prevented \nyou from doing with copyrighted works?\nImagine resorting to Google\u2019s search engine on your laptop or smartphone \nto settle a disagreement with a friend about some bit of trivia. You type in your \nsearch query , and Google comes up empty . You then learn that a court has \nrequired Google to delete its entire web index because it never entered into \ncopyright agreements with each individual author of each individual page on \nthe web. By indexing a web page and showing the public a snippet of the con -\ntents in their search results, the court has declared that Google violates the \ncopyrights of hundreds of millions of people and can no longer show those \nsearch results.\nFortunately, thanks to the exceptions and limitations built into copyright \nlaws in much of the world, including the fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright \nlaw, this hypothetical scenario is unlikely to become reality in most countries. \nThis is one of many illustrations that show  why it is so important that copyright \nhas built-in limitations and exceptions. - 32 -  CHaPter 2\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 State what limitations and exceptions to copyright are and why they exist\n\u2022 Name a few common exceptions and limitations to copyright\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nHave you ever made a copy of a creative work? Can you recall a time when you \nwere studying and you included properly cited quotations in a research paper \nyou wrote? Can you think of a way an exception or limitation to copyright has \nbenefited you?\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nCopyright is not absolute. There are some uses of copyrighted works that do \nnot require permission. These uses are limitations on the exclusive rights nor -\nmally granted to copyright holders and are known as \u201cexceptions and limita -\ntions\u201d to copyright.\nFair use, fair dealing, and other exceptions and limitations to copyright are \nan extremely important part of copyright design. Some countries afford excep -\ntions and limitations to copyright, such as fair dealing, while other countries do \nnot offer them at all.4 If your use of another person\u2019s copyrighted work is \u201cfair \nuse\u201d or falls within another exception or limitation to copyright, then you are \nnot infringing that creator\u2019s copyright. \nWhen legislators created copyright protections, they realized that allowing \ncopyright to restrict all the possible uses of creative works could be highly prob -\nlematic. For example, how could scholars and critics write about plays, books, \nmovies, or other artworks without quoting from them? (It would be extremely \ndifficult.) And would copyright holders be inclined to provide licenses or other \npermission to people whose reviews of their works might be negative? (Proba -\nbly not.)\nFor this and a range of other reasons, certain uses are explicitly carved out \nfrom copyright to widely different degrees depending on the jurisdiction\u2014\nincluding uses for the purposes of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teach -\ning, scholarship, research, parody, and access for the visually impaired . The use \nof copyrighted works\u2014or portions of those works\u2014for these purposes is not \nan infringement of those works\u2019 copyright when an exception or limitation to \ncopyright applies. These uses are known as \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d in some \nparts of the world.CoPyrI gHt La W  - 33 -\nThe Berne Convention first established the concept of \u201cfair use\u201d by providing \nthe following in Article 9, section 2. This is known as the \u201cthree-step\u201d test, and \nhas been adopted in some form in several other treaties: \nIt shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the \nreproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such repro -\nduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not \nunreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author . (emphasis added)\nFor more information about the scope and use of the three-step test, read the \nshort primer published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation at https://www  \n.eff.org/files/filenode/three-step_test_fnl.pdf.\nThe exceptions and limitations to copyright vary by country. There are \nglobal discussions around how to harmonize them. A World Intellectual Prop -\nerty Organization study (https://www. wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/copyright/en/\nsccr_30/sccr_30_3.pdf ) by Kenneth Crews compares the copyright exceptions \nand limitations for libraries in many countries around the world.\nGenerally speaking, there are two main ways in which limitations and excep -\ntions are written into copyright law. The first is by listing specific activities that \nare excluded from the reach of copyright. For example, Japanese copyright law \nhas a specific exemption allowing classroom broadcasts of copyrighted mate -\nrial. This approach has the benefit of providing clarity about precisely what \nuses by the public are allowed and are not considered infringing. However, it \ncan also be limiting because anything not specifically on the list of exceptions \nmay be deemed restricted by copyright. \nThe other approach is to include flexible guidelines about what is allowed in \nthe spirit of the three-step test described above. Courts then determine exactly \nwhat uses are allowed without the permission of the copyright holder. The \ndownside to flexible guidelines is that they leave more room for uncertainty . \nThis is the approach used in the United States with fair use, although U.S. copy -\nright law also has some specific exceptions to copyright written into the law \nas well. In the United States, fair use is determined usin g a four-factor test ,5 in \nwhich a federal court judge considers (1) the purpose and character of  use, (2) \nthe nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount and substantiality of the \nportion taken from the work, and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential \nmarket for the copyrighted work. (See the \u201cAdditional Resources\u201d section at the \nend of this chapter for a good selection of publications that discuss fair use and \nother exceptions and limitations to copyright.) - 34 -  CHaPter 2\nMost countries also have compulsory licensing schemes, which are another \nform of limitation on the exclusive rights of copyright holders. These statutory \nsystems make copyrighted content (for example, music) available for particu -\nlar types of reuse without asking permission, but they require payment of spec -\nified (and non-negotiable) fees to the copyright owners. Compulsory licensing \nschemes permit anyone to make certain uses of copyrighted works so long as \nthey pay a fee to the rights holder whose work will be used.\nAs an organization and a movement, Creative Commons supports strong \nexceptions and limitations to copyright. But the vision of Creative Commons\u2014\nuniversal access to research and education and full participation in culture\u2014\nwill not be realized through licensing alone. Creative Commons supports a \ncopyright system that appropriately balances the rights of creators and the \nrights of users and the general public.\nFinal Remarks\nLike the public domain, the exceptions and limitations to copyright are just \nas important as the exclusive rights that copyright grants. Think of them as a \nsafety valve for the public in order to be able to utilize copyrighted works for \nparticular uses in the public interest. You should educate yourself about the \nexceptions and limitations that apply in your country , so you can take advan -\ntage of and advocate for these critical user rights. \n2.5  |   ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nMore Information about Copyright Concepts\nLIABILITY AND REMEDIES \nGenerally , to establish a claim of copyright infringement, a creator or holder \nof copyright need only show that they have a valid copyright in the work and \nthat the defendant copied protected expression from the work. However, the \nintention of the alleged infringer may be relevant in some cases, such as if the \ndefendant asserts that an exception or limitation applied to their use or that \ntheir work was independently created.\nThe copyright laws of some countries grant copyright holders statutory \nremedies for infringement. The type and amounts of remedies, including dam -\nages, are established by law. You should be aware of the existence of statutory CoPyrI gHt La W  - 35 -\ndamages and other remedies permitted by applicable law, including statutory \nprovisions that award legal fees in some circumstances.  \nLICENSING AND TRANSFER\nMany creators and copyright holders need help to fully exercise their exclusive \nrights or simply give others permission to exercise the rights granted by copy -\nright law. Several options exist to do this. Some creators choose to license some \nor all of their rights, either exclusively or nonexclusively . Others choose to sell \ntheir rights outright and allow others to exercise them in their place, sometimes \nin exchange for royalty payments. There are often formalities associated with \nthe sale or licensing of copyrights, including when a copyright license must be \nin writing, depending on the copyright law that applies.\nTERMINATION OF COPYRIGHT TRANSFERS AND LICENSES\nThe laws of some countries grant copyright holders the right to terminate \ntransfer agreements or licenses even if the transfer agreement or license \ndoesn\u2019t allow it. In the United States, for example, copyright law provides \ntwo mechanisms for doing so, depending on when the transfer agreement or \nlicense became effective.

From the reuser\u2019s perspective, the \npresence of a Creative Commons license answers the question, \u201cWhat can I \ndo with this?\u201d and provides the freedom to reuse the work of others, subject to \nclearly defined conditions.\nAll CC licenses ensure that creators retain their copyright and get credit for \ntheir work, while still permitting others to copy and distribute it. Although the \nCC legal tools are designed to be as easy to use as possible, there are still some \nthings to learn in order to fully understand their mechanics.\nThis chapter has five sections: \n1.

While there are several different CC license options, all of \nthem grant permission to use the works under certain standardized conditions. \nThe licenses grant those permissions for as long as the underlying copyright \nlasts or until/unless you violate the license terms. This is what we mean when \nwe say CC licenses work on top of copyright, not instead of copyright.\nThe CC licenses were designed to be a free, voluntary solution for creators \nwho want to grant the public up-front permission to use their works. Although \nthe licenses are legally enforceable tools, they were designed in a way that was \nintended to make them accessible to non-lawyers. \nThe licenses are built using a three-layer design (figure 3.1). \n1. The legal code  is the base layer. This contains the \u201clawyer-readable\u201d terms \nand conditions that are legally enforceable in court. Take a minute and \nscan through the legal code of CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by/4.0/legalcode) to see how it is structured. Can you find where \nthe attribution requirements are listed?\n2. The commons deeds  are the best-known layer of the licenses. These \nare the web pages that lay out the key license terms in \u201chuman-read -anatomy of a CC LICense  - 41 -\nable\u201d terms. The deeds are not legally \nenforceable but instead summarize the \nlegal code. Take some time to explore \nthe deeds for CC BY ( https://creative  \ncommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 ) and  \nCC BY-NC-ND  (https://creativecommons  \n.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ) and iden -\ntify how they differ. Can you find the \nlinks to the legal code from each deed? \n3. The final layer of the license design \nrecognizes that software plays a crit -\nical role in the creation, copying, dis -\ncovery , and distribution of works. In \norder to make it easy for websites and \nweb services to know when a work \nis available under a Creative Commons license, we provide a \u201cmachine-  \nreadable\u201d version of the license (see figure 3.2)\u2014this is a summary of the \nkey freedoms granted and obligations imposed, and is written into a for -\nmat that applications, search engines, and other kinds of technology can \nunderstand. We developed a standardized way to describe licenses that \nsoftware can understand called CC Rights Expression Language (CC REL) \nto accomplish this. When this metadata is attached to CC-licensed works, \nsomeone searching for a CC-licensed work using a search engine (e.g., \nGoogle Advanced Search) can more easily discover CC-licensed works.\nFIGURE 3.1  The three layers  \nof a CC license\nFIGURE 3.2   Example of  \n\u201cmachine readable\u201d code\nFrom Creative Commons License \nChooser: https://creativecommons.org/\nchoose/\nCC BY 4.0- 42 -  CHaPter 3\nCC LICENSE BASICS\nAll Creative Commons licenses have many important features in common. At a \nminimum, every license helps creators (we call them \u201clicensors\u201d when they use \nCC tools) retain copyright while allowing others to copy and distribute their \nwork. Every CC license also ensures that licensors get credit for their work. CC \nlicenses work around the world and last as long as the applicable copyright lasts \n(because they are built on copyright) and as long as the user complies with the \nlicense. These common features serve as the baseline, on top of which licensors \ncan choose to grant additional permissions when deciding how they want their \nwork to be used.\nNOTE  Throughout all of the CC Certificate content, please assume that all descriptions \nof the licenses refer to the most recent version of the CC license suite, Version 4.0, \nunless otherwise indicated. You will learn more about the different versions in section 3.3 \n\u201cLicense Types.\u201d\nCHOICES  FOR THE LICENSOR\nAll Creative Commons licenses are structured to give the user permission to \nmake a wide range of uses as long as the user complies with the conditions in the \nlicense. The basic condition in all of the licenses is that the user provides credit \nto the licensor and certain other information, such as where the original work \nmay be found.\nA CC licensor makes a few simple decisions on the path to choosing a license: \nfirst, do I want to allow commercial use of my work; and second, do I want to \nallow derivative works (also known as adaptations)? We\u2019ll address adaptations \nin greater detail within chapter 4.\nIf a licensor decides to allow derivative works, they may also choose to \nrequire that anyone who uses the work\u2014we call them \u201clicensees\u201d\u2014make their \nnew work available under the same license terms. This is what is meant by \u201cSha -\nreAlike, \u201d and it is one of the mechanisms that has helped the digital commons of \nCC-licensed content grow over time. ShareAlike is inspired by the GNU General \nPublic License, which is used by many free and open-source software projects.\nThese different license elements are symbolized by visual icons, as shown \nin figures 3.3a to 3.3d below.\nThe symbol shown in figure 3.3a means Attribution  or \u201cBY . \u201d This license \nmeans that others who use your work must give you credit for it (i.e., attribute \nit to you) in the way you request. All of the licenses include this condition. !anatomy of a CC LICense  - 43 -\nThe symbol shown in figure 3.3b means NonCommercial  or \u201cNC, \u201d which \nmeans the work is only available to be used for non-commercial purposes. \nThree of the CC licenses include this restriction. \nThe symbol shown in figure 3.3c means ShareAlike  or \u201c SA, \u201d which means \nthat any adaptations and modified versions based on this work must adhere to \nthe terms of the original license. Two of the CC licenses include this condition: \nAttribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA), and Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike \n(CC BY-NC-SA). \nThe symbol shown in figure 3.3d means NoDerivatives  or \u201cND, \u201d which means \nthat reusers cannot share adaptations or modified versions of the work. Two of \nthe CC licenses include this restriction: Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND), and \nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND). \nWhen combined, these icons represent the six CC license options. The icons \nare also embedded in the \u201clicense icons, \u201d which each represent a particular CC \nlicense type. The next section in this chapter, \u201cLicense Types, \u201d explores the six \ncombinations in detail.\nFIGURES 3.3 A-D    \nDifferent license elementsa\ncb\nd- 44 -  CHaPter 3\nPUBLIC DOMAIN TOOLS\nIn addition to the CC license suite, Creative Commons also has two public \ndomain tools, which are represented by the icons in figures 3.4a and 3.4b above. \nThese public domain tools are not licenses.\nCC0 (figure 3.4a) enables creators to dedicate their works to the worldwide \npublic domain to the greatest extent possible. Note that some jurisdictions do \nnot allow creators to dedicate their works to the public domain, so CC0 has other \nlegal mechanisms included to help deal with this situation where it applies. \n(There is more on this in section 3.3 \u201cLicense Types. \u201d)\nThe Public Domain Mark (figure 3.4b) is a label used to mark works that are \nknown to be free of all copyright restrictions. Unlike CC0, the Public Domain \nMark is not a legal tool and has no legal effect when applied to a work. It serves \nonly as a label to inform the public about the public domain status of a work and \nis often used by museums and archives working with very old works. \nFinal Remarks\nThere is a learning curve to some of the terminology and basics about how CC \nlegal tools work. But as you now know, it is far less intimidating than it looks. \nNow that you understand how to \u201cspeak CC\u201d and know some of the fundamen -\ntals about CC license design, you are well on your way to becoming versed in CC \nlicensing.\na b\nFIGURE 3.4 A CC0\nFIGURE 3.4 B Public Domain Markanatomy of a CC LICense  - 45 -\n3.2  |   LICENSE SCOPE\nCreative Commons licenses are built on copyright law. This simple fact tells \nyou most of what you need to know about when they do and do not apply , and \nhow long they last.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Describe how CC works with copyright and why this is important\n\u2022 Explain the time length of a CC license\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nWhat is the legal foundation upon which CC licenses operate? And why is this \nso important? \nCC licenses are copyright licenses. They apply where and when copyright \napplies. This reflects a fundamental design decision by the founders of Cre -\native Commons. Given that the goal was to make more creative and educational \nworks available under common-sense terms, Creative Commons wanted to \nensure that its licenses were not used to restrict works or uses of works that the \ncopyright law does not restrict. This is a core CC value. Having the language of \nthe licenses track copyright law accomplished this goal.\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nThink about what it would mean if a CC license could prevent you from doing \nsomething you could otherwise do with a copyrighted work, such as printing \na copy of a poem to insert in a birthday card for a friend. Do you understand \nwhy having CC licenses track copyright was an important decision for the \nfounders of Creative Commons?\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge \nThe statement that \u201cCreative Commons licenses are copyright licenses\u201d tells \nyou the following about the licenses:\n1. The licenses \u201coperate\u201d or apply only when the work is within the scope \nof copyright law (or other related laws) and the restrictions of copyright \nlaw apply to the intended use of the work. (This is discussed in more \ndetail below.) \n2. Certain other rights, such as patents, trademarks, and privacy and pub -\nlicity rights are not covered by the licenses and must be managed sepa -\nrately . - 46 -  CHaPter 3\nThe first of these statements explains a basic limitation of the licenses in \ncontrolling what people do with the work, and the second statement provides a \nwarning that there may be other rights at play with the work that restrict how \nit is used.\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE CC LICENSE TO APPLY  \nWHERE COPYRIGHT APPLIES?\nCC licenses are appropriate for creators who have created something protect -\nable by copyright, such as an image, an article, or a book, and who want to pro -\nvide people with one or more of the permissions governed by copyright law. \nFor example, if you want to give others permission to freely copy and redistrib -\nute your work, you can use a CC license to grant those permissions. Likewise, \nif you want to give others permission to freely transform, alter, or otherwise \ncreate derivative works based on your work, you can use a CC license to grant \nthose permissions.\nHowever, you don\u2019t need to use a Creative Commons license to give some -\none permission to read your article or watch your video, because reading and \nwatching aren\u2019t activities that copyright generally regulates.\nHere are two more important scenarios in which a user does not need a copy -\nright license:1\n\u2022 When fair use, fair dealing, or some other limitation and exception to \ncopyright applies (see the relevant FAQ at https:/ / creativecommons.org/\nfaq/#do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-exceptions-and-limitations-to  \n-copyright-such-as-fair-dealing-and-fair-use  ). \n\u2022 When the work is in the public domain (see the relevant FAQ1 at https:/ /\ncreativecommons.org/faq/#may-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-a  \n-work-in-the-public-domain ).\nBECAUSE USERS DON\u2019T NEED COPYRIGHT LICENSES IN THESE  \nSCENARIOS, CC LICENSES AREN\u2019T NEEDED\nCan you think of reasons why someone might try to apply a CC license to a work \nthat is not covered by copyright in their own country? Or reasons why a CC \nlicensor might expect attribution every time their work is used, even for a use \nthat is not prohibited by copyright law?\nThese users might be trying to exert control that they do not actually have \nby law. But more likely than not, they simply don\u2019t know that copyright does anatomy of a CC LICense  - 47 -\nnot apply , or that a work is in the public domain. Or, for the savvy licensor, they \nmay realize that their work is in the public domain in some countries but not \neverywhere, and they want to be sure that everyone everywhere will be able to \nreuse it. \nFor a real-life example, let\u2019s look at what happens when you want to use CC \nlicenses in a field like 3D printing. Look at the resource provided by Public \nKnowledge (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0, available at https://www.publicknowledge  \n.org/assets/uploads/documents/3_Steps_for_Licensing_Your_3D_Printed_Stuff  \n.pdf  ) about how to apply a CC license in the 3D printing field. It is easy to see \nhow complicated the legal issues can become, particularly in newly emerging \nfields like this one.\nOne other subtle but important difference about the scope of CC licenses is \nthat they also cover other rights that are closely related to copyright. These are \ndefined as \u201cSimilar Rights\u201d in the CC license legal code, and they include related \nand neighboring rights and what are known as \u201csui genesis database rights, \u201d \nwhich are rights in some countries restricting the extraction and reuse of the \ncontents of a database. See section 2.1 \u201cCopyright Basics\u201d for a refresher on \nwhat Similar Rights covers. Just as with copyright, the CC license conditions \nonly come into play when Similar Rights otherwise apply to the work and  to the \nparticular reuse made by someone using the CC-licensed work.\nThe other critical part of the statement \u201cCC licenses are copyright licenses\u201d \nis that there may be other rights in a work upon which the license has no effect\u2014\nfor example, privacy rights. Again, CC licenses do not have any effect on rights \nbeyond copyright and Similar Rights as defined in the licenses, so other rights \nhave to be managed separately . Read the FAQ about this issue at https://creative  \ncommons.org/faq/#does-a-creative-commons-license-give-me-all-the-rights-i  \n-need-to-use-the-work .\nWhile it is not required, Creative Commons urges creators to make sure that \nthere are no  other rights  that may prevent the reuse of their work as intended. \nCC licensors do not make any warranties about the reuse of the work. This \nmeans that unless the licensor is offering a separate warranty , it is incumbent \non the reuser to determine whether other rights may impact their intended \nreuse of the work. Learning more about this can sometimes be as easy as con -\ntacting the licensor to inquire about these possible other rights. Read through \nthe complete list of considerations for licensees of CC-licensed works, licensed \nCC BY 4.0, at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for  \n_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees .- 48 -  CHaPter 3\nWHAT TYPES OF CONTENT CAN BE CC-LICENSED?\nYou can apply a CC license to anything protected by copyright that you own, \nwith one important exception. \nCC urges creators not to apply CC licenses to software. This is because there \nare many free and open-source software licenses which do that job better; they \nwere built specifically as software licenses. For example, most open-source \nsoftware licenses include provisions about distributing the software\u2019 s source \ncode \u2014but the CC licenses do not address this important aspect of sharing soft -\nware. The software-sharing ecosystem is well established, and there are many \ngood open-source software licenses to choose from. An FAQ from Creative \nCommons\u2019 website available at https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply  \n-a-creative-commons-license-to-software  has more information about why we \ndiscourage the use of our licenses for software. \nWHOSE RIGHTS ARE COVERED BY THE CC LICENSE?\nA CC license on a given work only covers the copyright held by the person who \napplied the license\u2014the licensor. This might sound obvious, but it is an import -\nant point to understand. For example, many employers own the copyright to \nworks created by their employees, so if an employee applies a CC license to a \nwork owned by their employer, they are not able to give any permission what -\nsoever to reuse the work. The person who applies the license needs to be either \nthe creator or someone who has acquired the rights to the work.\nAdditionally , a work may incorporate the copyrighted work of another, such \nas a scholarly article that uses a copyrighted photograph to illustrate an idea \n(after having received the permission of the owner of the photograph to include \nit). The CC license applied by the author of the scholarly article does not apply \nto the photograph, only to the remainder of the work. Separate permission may \nneed to be obtained in order to reproduce the photograph (but not the remain -\nder of the article). See section 3.4 \u201cLicense Enforceability\u201d for more details on \nhow to handle these situations. \nAlso, works often have more than one copyright attached to them. For exam -\nple, a filmmaker may own the copyright to a film adaptation of a book, but the \nbook author also holds a copyright to the book on which the film is based. In this \nexample, if the film is CC-licensed, the CC license only applies to the film and not \nthe book. The user may need to separately obtain a license to use the copyright -\nable content from the book that is part of the film.anatomy of a CC LICense  - 49 -\nFinal Remarks\nA key to understanding how Creative Commons works is understanding that \nthe licenses depend on copyright to function. This seemingly simple concept \nexplains a lot about when the tools apply and how much of a work they cover.\n3.3  |   LICENSE TYPES\nThere are six different CC licenses, which are designed to help accommodate \nthe diverse needs of creators while still using simple, standardized terms.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Explain the CC license suite\n\u2022 Describe the different CC license elements\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nWhy are there so many different Creative Commons licenses?\nThere is no single Creative Commons license. The CC license suite (which \nincludes the six CC licenses) and the CC0 Public Domain Dedication offer cre -\nators a range of options. At first, all of these choices can appear daunting. But \nwhen you dig into the options, you will realize that the spectrum of choices is \nfairly simple.\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nThink about a piece of creative or academic work you made that you are partic -\nularly proud of. If you shared that work with others, would you have been okay \nwith them adapting it or using it for commercial purposes? Why or why not? \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nCreative Commons licenses are standardized tools, but part of the vision is \nto provide a range of options for creators who are interested in sharing their \nworks with the public rather than reserving all rights under copyright. \nThe four license elements\u2014BY , SA, NC, and ND\u2014combine to make up six dif -\nferent license options. \nAll of the licenses include the BY condition. In other words, all of the licenses \nrequire that the creator be attributed in connection with their work. Beyond \nthat commonality , the licenses vary as to whether (1) commercial use of the \nwork is permitted, and (2) whether the work can be adapted or modified, and if \nso, on what terms.- 50 -  CHaPter 3\nThe six licenses, from least to most restrictive in terms of the freedoms \ngranted reusers, are shown in figures 3.5a to 3.5f.\nThe Attribution license,  or CC BY  (figure 3.5a), allows people to use the work \nfor any purpose (even commercially and even in modified form) as long as they \ngive attribution to the creator. \nThe Attribution-ShareAlike  license, or BY-SA  (figure 3.5b), allows people to \nuse the work for any purpose (even commercially and even in modified form), \nas long as they give attribution to the creator and make any adaptations they \nshare with others available under the same or a compatible license. This is Cre -\native Commons\u2019 version of a copyleft license  (a type of open source software \nlicense that makes the license permissions viral by design), and is the license \nrequired for the content uploaded to Wikipedia , for example.\nThe Attribution-NonCommercial  license, or BY-NC  (figure 3.5c), allows people \nto use the work for noncommercial purposes only , and only as long as they give \nattribution to the creator. \nThe Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike  license, or BY-NC-SA  (figure 3.5d), \nallows people to use the work for noncommercial purposes only , and only as \nlong as they give attribution to the creator and make any adaptations they share \nwith others available under the same or a compatible license.\nFIGURES 3.5 a-f   \nThe six BY licensesa\nb\ncd\ne\nfanatomy of a CC LICense  - 51 -\nThe Attribution-NoDerivatives  license, or BY-ND  (figure 3.5e), allows people \nto use the unadapted work for any purpose (even commercially), as long as they \ngive attribution to the creator. But they cannot use adapted or modified ver -\nsions of the work (these are called \u201c derivatives \u201d).\nThe Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives  license, or BY-NC-ND  (figure \n3.5f ), is the most restrictive license offered by Creative Commons. It allows peo -\nple to use the unadapted work for noncommercial purposes only , and only as \nlong as they give attribution to the licensor. Adaptations or modified versions \nof the work are not permitted. \nTo really understand how the different license options work, let\u2019s dig into \nthe different license elements. Attribution is a part of all CC licenses, and we \nwill dissect exactly what type of attribution is required in chapter 4. For now, \nlet\u2019s focus on what makes the licenses different. \nCOMMERCIAL VS. NONCOMMERCIAL USE\nNoncommercial (NC)\nAs we know, three of the licenses (BY-NC, BY-NC-SA, and \nBY-NC-ND) limit reuse of the work to noncommercial \npurposes only . In the legal code, a noncommercial pur -\npose is defined as one that is \u201cnot primarily intended for \nor directed towards commercial advantage or monetary \ncompensation. \u201d This phrasing is intended to provide flexibility depending on \nthe facts surrounding the reuse, without overly specifying exact situations that \ncould exclude some prohibited and some permitted reuses.\nIt is important to note that CC\u2019s definition of NC depends on the use, not \nthe user. If you are a nonprofit or charitable organization, your use of an NC-  \nlicensed work could still run afoul of the NC restriction, and if you are a for-profit \nentity , your use of an NC-licensed work does not necessarily mean you have \nviolated the license terms. For example, a nonprofit entity cannot sell another\u2019s \nNC-licensed work for a profit, and a for-profit entity may use an NC-licensed \nwork for noncommercial purposes. Whether a use is commercial depends on \nthe specifics of the situation. See our CC \u201cNonCommercial Interpretation\u201d page, \nlicensed CC BY 4.0, at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial  \n_interpretation  for more information and examples.\n- 52 -  CHaPter 3\nADAPTATIONS\nThe other differences between the licenses hinge on whether, and on what \nterms, reusers can adapt and then share the licensed work. The question of \nwhat constitutes an adaptation of a licensed work depends on applicable copy -\nright law (for a reminder, see chapter 2). One of the exclusive rights granted to \ncreators under copyright is the right to create adaptations or modified versions \nof their works or, as they are sometimes called, \u201cderivative works. \u201d Examples \nof these adaptations include creating a movie based on a book or translating a \nbook from one language to another.\nAs a legal matter, at times it is tricky to determine exactly what is and is not \nan adaptation. Here are some handy rules about the licenses to keep in mind:\nTechnical format-shifting (for example, converting a licensed work from \na digital format to a physical copy) is not  an adaptation regardless of what the \napplicable copyright law may otherwise provide.\n\u2022 Fixing minor problems with spelling or punctuation is not an adaptation. \n\u2022 Syncing a musical work with a moving image is an adaptation regardless \nof what the applicable copyright law may otherwise provide.\n\u2022 Reproducing and putting works together into a collection is not  an adapta -\ntion of the individual works. For example, combining stand-alone essays \nby several authors into an essay collection for use as an open textbook is a \ncollection and not  an adaptation. Most open courseware is a collection of \nothers\u2019 open educational resources (OER).\n\u2022 Including an image in connection with text, as in a blog post, a Power -\nPoint, or an article, does not create an adaptation unless the photo itself is \nadapted.\nNoDerivatives\nTwo of the CC licenses (BY-ND and BY-NC-ND) prohibit reus -\ners from sharing (i.e., distributing or making available) \nadaptations of the licensed work. To be clear, this means \nthat anyone may create adaptations of works under an ND \nlicense so long as they don\u2019t share the work with others in \nadapted form. This allows, among other things, organizations to engage in text \nand data mining without violating the ND term.\nanatomy of a CC LICense  - 53 -\nShareAlike\nTwo of the licenses (BY-SA and BY-NC-SA) require that if \nadaptations of the licensed work are shared, they must be \nmade available under the same or a compatible license. For \nShareAlike purposes, the list of compatible licenses is short. \nIt includes later versions of the same license (e.g., BY-SA 4.0 \nis compatible with BY-SA 3.0) and a few non-CC licenses designated as compati -\nble by Creative Commons (e.g., the Free Art License). You can read more about \nthis at the CC wiki ShareAlike Compatibility page, licensed CC BY 4.0, available \nat https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility, but the \nmost important thing to remember is that ShareAlike requires that if you share \nyour adaptation, you must do so using the same or a compatible license.\nPublic Domain\nIn addition to the CC license suite, Creative Commons also \nhas an option for creators who want to take a \u201cno rights \nreserved\u201d approach and disclaim copyright entirely . This is \nCC0, the Public Domain Dedication tool .\nLike the CC licenses, CC0 (read \u201cCC Zero\u201d) uses the three-\nlayer design\u2014legal code, deed, and metadata. The CC0 legal code itself uses a \nthree-pronged legal approach. The first approach is for the creator to simply \nwaive all of their rights to the work. But some countries do not allow creators to \ndedicate their work to the public domain through a waiver or abandonment of \ntheir rights, so CC0 includes a \u201cfallback\u201d license that allows anyone in the world \nto do anything with the work unconditionally . The fallback license comes into \nplay when the waiver fails for any reason. And finally , in the rare instance that \nboth the waiver and the \u201cfallback\u201d license are not enforceable, CC includes a \npromise by the person applying CC0 to their work that they will not assert copy -\nright against reusers in a manner that interferes with their stated intention of \nsurrendering all rights in the work.\nLike the licenses, CC0 is a copyright tool, but it also covers a few additional \nrights beyond those covered by the CC licenses, such as noncompetition laws. \nFrom a reuse perspective, there still may be other rights that require clearance \nseparately , such as trademark and patent rights, and third-party rights in the \nwork, such as publicity or privacy rights.\n- 54 -  CHaPter 3\nFinal Remarks\nCreative Commons legal tools were designed to provide a solution to compli -\ncated laws in a standardized way , making them as easy as possible for non-  \nlawyers to use and apply . Understanding the basic legal principles in this sec -\ntion will help you use the CC licenses and public domain tools more effectively .\n3.4  |   LICENSE ENFORCEABILITY\nCreative Commons licenses have been carefully crafted to make them legally \nenforceable in countries around the world.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Describe the state of Creative Commons case law\n\u2022 Explain the potential benefits of seeking nonlegal resolutions  \nto disagreements\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nCreative Commons licenses are legal tools that build on copyright law. As legal \ninstruments, CC licenses need to stand up in court. What happens when there is \na court case that involves CC licenses? What happens if someone is violating the \nCC license you applied to a work, but you don\u2019t want to file a lawsuit? What hap -\npens if a licensor complains about how you have attributed them when reusing \ntheir work?\nTo date and to our knowledge, no court around the world that has heard a \ncase involving a CC license (and there have been very few such cases) has ques -\ntioned the validity or enforceability of a CC license. Thanks to the Creative Com -\nmons community , most disputes connected to CC licenses are resolved outside \nof court and often without involving lawyers.\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nWhether you or your organization are using CC licenses, or you\u2019re advising \nothers in the use of such licenses, you want to be confident that the terms of \nthose licenses are enforceable. If someone misuses your work, what recourse \ndo you have? What would you do if you found out that someone was using your \nCC-licensed photograph in a magazine without giving you credit, for example?anatomy of a CC LICense  - 55 -\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge \nMost people who reuse CC-licensed works try to comply with the license condi -\ntions. But whether well-meaning or not, sometimes people get it wrong. \nIf someone is using a CC-licensed work without giving attribution or oth -\nerwise following the license, their right to use the work ends automatically \nas soon as they violate the license terms.

Over the course of Cre -\native Commons\u2019 history , to our knowledge, there have been very few legal dis -\nputes and decisions involving CC legal tools. Each court that has rendered a deci -\nsion has made it without questioning the enforceability of the CC license at issue.\nUnder Version 4.0, users of CC-licensed works who come into compliance \nwith license terms within thirty days of discovering they were in violation \nof the terms have their rights under the license automatically reinstated.- 56 -  CHaPter 3\nThose judicial decisions have been in a variety of places around the world, \nincluding Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany , Sweden, Israel, and the \nUnited States. Creative Commons maintains a listing of court decisions and case \nlaw from jurisdictions around the world on its wiki, licensed CC BY 4.0, avail -\nable at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Law. \nIn all of these decisions, no court has questioned the validity of a CC license \nin the case. While a CC license played a minor role in some of the cases, in others \nthe court has held the defendant liable for copyright infringement for failing to \nfollow the CC license terms. You can read about one such decision at the CC wiki \npage Curry v . Audax, licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at https://wiki.creative  \ncommons.org/wiki/Curry_v ._Audax.\nLegal enforceability is one of the key features of CC licensing.  While the licenses \nare widely seen as symbols of free and open sharing, they also carry legal \nweight. The CC legal code was written by lawyers with the help of a global net -\nwork of international copyright experts. The result is a set of terms and condi -\ntions that are intended to operate and be enforceable everywhere in the world.\nLICENSE VERSIONS\nAs noted above, there are different versions of CC licenses. These are not to \nbe confused with the different types  of licenses described in section 3.3. The \nlicense version number simply represents when that particular version of the \nCC legal code was written. Creative Commons improves its licenses through \nthe process of versioning, by which we update the legal code to better account \nfor changes in copyright law and technology , and the needs of reusers. While \nthere are some differences between license versions, the different versions are \nlargely the same in practical effect. The latest version of the CC license suite is \nVersion 4.0 , which was published in 2013. Details on what update s were made to \nthe licenses in Version 4.0 can be found at https://creativecommons.org/share  \n-your-work/licensing-considerations/version4 . For the most definitive and com-\nprehensive view of how the licenses have changed from Version 1.0 to the pres -\nent, including all changes to the attribution and marking requirements, visit \nthe CC wiki page, licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https://wiki.creativecommons  \n.org/wiki/License_Versions .\nIn all cases, we recommend that creators use the latest version of the licenses, \nbecause it reflects the latest thinking of Creative Commons and its global net -\nwork of legal experts.anatomy of a CC LICense  - 57 -\nOFFICIAL TRANSLATIONS OF CC LEGAL TOOLS\nThe latest versions of all the CC licenses (and other tools) may be translated \ninto official versions in other languages. Creative Commons has a formal pro -\ncess (see the Legal Code Translation Policy , licensed CC BY 4.0 and available \nat https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Legal_Code_Translation_Policy) by \nwhich this is done in order to ensure that the translations are as close to the \noriginal as possible. Creative Commons\u2019 goal is to get the licenses into as many \nlanguages as possible, so that everyone can read and understand the terms in \ntheir native language. The official translations are noted at the bottom of the \nlegal code on all of the licenses and are equivalents of one another.\nMany people ask about the relationship between the official translations and \nthe English originals. All official translations are linguistic translations only , \nunlike ported versions (which are described in the text box below). The official \ntranslations are legal equivalents of one another, which means they have the \nsame legal meaning and effect in each language. This is similar to how standards \nbodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium translate a single standard \ninto many different languages, and how the United Nations publishes treaties.\nRESOLVING DISPUTES\nSince the publication of Version 1.0 of the licenses in 2002, Creative Commons \nis aware of a relatively small number of disputes between licensors and reus -\ners over its licenses, including the NonCommercial term and attribution. There \nmay be several explanations for this state of harmony . As observed by Creative \nCommons in its \u201cDefining \u2018 Noncommercial \u2019\u201d report (licensed CC BY 3.0 and \nDistinguishing ported versions of the pre-4.0 versions of the CC licenses. \nPrior to the publication of Version 4.0 in November 2013, Creative Commons gave permis -\nsion to the CC Global Network to \u201cport\u201d the Creative Commons licenses. Porting involved \nlinguistic translation and adjustments so that the licenses reflected local terminology and \ndrafting protocols, and it accounted for other local differences, such as the existence of moral \nrights and collecting societies.\nOne of the primary reasons for versioning the licenses from 3.0 to 4.0 was to eliminate \nthe need for porting, an unnecessarily complex process that could be eliminated if Creative \nCommons took proper care to ensure that the new licenses were internationalized. Start -\ning with Version 4.0, the most recent version of the CC license suite, Creative Commons no \nlonger \u201cports\u201d the licenses. The ported licenses of previous versions may still be used and \nremain legally valid and enforceable; however, Creative Commons discourages their use \nand recommends Version 4.0 as the latest and most up-to-date thinking of CC and its global  \nnetwork.- 58 -  CHaPter 3\navailable at https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/defining-noncommercial/\nDefining_Noncommercial_fullreport.pdf ), the expectations of licensors and \nreusers of CC-licensed content may play a role here. For example, NC licensors \noften intend for broad reuse of their NC-licensed content, as long as it is not \nreused primarily for commercial gain. However, the reusers of NC-licensed \ncontent may assume more conservative license terms around commercial \nreuse. As a result, NC-licensed content is not often reused to the full extent \nof the permissions that the license affords or the licensor intends. And often, \nwhen disputes around CC-licensed content do arise, they are resolved amicably \nand out of court, frequently without involving lawyers. Instead, disputes are \nresolved through outreach by the licensor to the user, and an accord is struck to \nfix any actual problem. \nNote that Creative Commons accounted for this practice in Version 4.0. \nWhereas prior to 4.0, any violation of the license automatically terminated the \nlicense, and the violator had to seek new and express permission from the licen -\nsor to reuse the work again, in Version 4.0, the license automatically reinstates \nif the violator corrects the problem within thirty days of having become aware \nof it. This encourages reusers to do the right thing\u2014correct their violations as \nsoon as possible upon discovery , whether or not the licensor has made a claim. \nThis can help avoid disputes.\nIn many ways, both of these practices\u2014being more generous and respectful, \nand outreach to solve any perceived violations\u2014are a testament to the values \nheld and practiced by the CC community of creators and reusers. Creative Com -\nmons encourages healthy , open interactions between licensors and those reus -\ning their works.\nFinal Remarks\nThe legal robustness of the CC licenses is critically important. With the help \nof an international network of legal and policy experts, the CC licenses are \naccepted and enforceable worldwide. To date, no court has declared the licenses \nunenforceable, and very few lawsuits have ensued. In the vast majority of cases, \nthe CC community has resolved any disputes outside of the courtroom.anatomy of a CC LICense  - 59 -\n3.5  |   ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\u2022 \u201cAbout the Open Publication License, \u201d  by David Wiley .

There are several options for creators who choose to share their work \nby using CC. There are also many things to think about before applying any CC \nlicense or CC0, including whether you have all the rights you need and if not, \nhow you must indicate that to the public.\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nHow would you go about choosing a particular CC license for your work? Do \nyou know how to go about actually attaching a license to your work once you \nhave chosen one? What if you change your mind about the license?\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nBefore you decide that you want to apply a CC license or CC0 to your creative \nwork, there are some important things to consider: \n\u2022 The licenses and CC0 are irrevocable.  The word irrevocable  means that a \nlegal agreement cannot be canceled. This means that once you apply a CC \nlicense to a work, that license applies to the work until the copyright on \nthe work expires. This aspect of CC licensing is highly desirable from the \nperspective of reusers because they can be confident that the creator can -\nnot arbitrarily pull back the rights granted them under the CC license. \n \u00bbBecause the licenses are irrevocable, it is very important to care -\nfully consider your options before deciding to apply a CC license to \na work.\n\u2022 You must own or control copyright in the work . You should control copy -\nright in the work to which you apply the CC license. For example, you don\u2019t \nown or control any copyright in a work that is in the public domain,  and \nyou don\u2019t own or control the copyright to an  Enrique Iglesias song. Fur -UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 63 -\nthermore, if you created the material in the scope of your employment, \nyou may not be the holder of the rights and may need to get permission \nfrom your employer before applying a CC license to it. Before licensing, \nbe mindful about whether you have copyright to the work to which you\u2019re \napplying a CC license.\nWHICH CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE SHOULD I USE?\nThe six CC licenses provide a range of options for creators who want to share \ntheir work with the public while still retaining copyright. The best way to \ndecide which license is appropriate for you is to think about why you want to \nshare your work, and how you hope others will use that work.\nFor example, here are a few questions to consider:\n\u2022 Do you think people might make interesting new works out of your cre -\nation? Do you want to give people the ability to translate your writing into \ndifferent languages, or otherwise customize it for their own needs? If so, \nthen you should choose a license that allows your work to be adapted.\n\u2022 Is it important to you that your images are able to be incorporated into \nWikipedia ? If so, then you should choose either CC BY , BY-SA, or CC0, \nbecause Wikipedia  does not allow images licensed under any of the Non -\nCommercial or NoDerivatives licenses except in limited circumstances.\n\u2022 Do you want to give away all of your rights in your work so that it can \nbe used by anyone in the world for any purpose? Then you might want to \nthink about using the Public Domain Dedication tool, CC0.\nIf you need some help deciding which license might be best for you, this flow -\nchart from CC Australia might be useful (please note that the information it \ncontains is not legal advice): see figure 4.2 or go to http://creativecommons.org  \n.au/learn/fact-sheets/licensing-flowchart/ .\nHOW DO I APPLY A CC LICENSE TO MY WORK?\nOnce you\u2019ve decided you want to use a CC license and know which license you \nwant to use, applying it is simple. Technically , all you have to do is indicate \nwhich CC license you are applying to your work. However, we strongly rec -\nommend including a link (or writing out the CC license URL, if you are work -\ning offline) to the relevant CC license deed (e.g., https://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by/4.0 ). You can do this in the copyright notice for your work, on the - 64 -  CHaPter 4\nFIGURE 4.2 Which Creative Commons license is right for me?\nImage from Creative Commons Australia: http://creativecommons.org.au/learn/fact-sheets/\nlicensing-flowchart/\nAuthor: CC Australia   |  CC BY 3.0  |  Desaturated from originalUsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 65 -\nfooter of your website, or any other place that makes sense in light of the partic -\nular format and medium of your work. The important thing is to make it clear \nwhat the CC license covers and locate the notice in a place which makes that clear \nto the public. See \u201cMarking Your Work with a CC License\u201d (licensed CC BY 4.0 \nand available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work  \n_with_a_CC_license ) on the Creative Commons website for more information. \nIndicating which CC license you choose can be as simple as the notice from \nthe footer of BC Open Textbooks (https://open.bccampus.ca/find-open-textbooks),  \nshown in figure 4.3.\nIf you are on a platform like Medium or Flickr, you should use the built-in CC \nlicense tools on the platform to mark your work with the CC license you choose.\nIf you have a personal blog or a website, we recommend using the CC license \nchooser  to generate code that identifies your chosen license. That code can be \ncopied and inserted into your work online. \nYou should take some time to play around with the CC license chooser, at \nhttps://creativecommons.org/choose/, now (figure 4.4). After you select the \nboxes that indicate your preferences, the chooser generates the appropriate \nlicense based on your selections. Remember, the license chooser is not a regis -\ntration page, it simply provides you with standardized HTML code, icons and \nlicense statements.\nIn figure 4.4, do you see the text and icon just above the code? That text/links \ncan also be copied and pasted onto your work to mark the work with a CC license.\nIf you want to mark the work in a different way or need to use a different \nformat like closing titles in a video, you can visit https://creativecommons.org/\nabout/downloads/  and access downloadable versions of all of the CC icons.\nFIGURE 4.3 Screenshot of the footer of BC Open Textbooks\nHow to Apply a CC0 License\nLike the licenses, CC0 has its own chooser.

Here are three cases in which you will \nmark CC-licensed works:\n1. Marking your own work  so that others can easily discover it, reuse it, and \ngive you credit or attribution. The best practice for marking your work \nis to follow the TASL approach for your own portions of the content, and \nfor the portions of the content created by others:\n \u00bbT = Title\n \u00bbA = Author (tell reusers who to give credit to) \n \u00bbS = Source (give reusers a link to the resource)\n \u00bbL = License (provide a link to the CC license deed)\nWhen providing attribution, the goal is to mark the work with full TASL \ninformation. When you don\u2019t have some of the TASL information about \na work, do the best you can and include as much detail as possible in the \nmarking statement.\nYou should note that starting with Version 4.0, the licenses no longer \nrequire a reuser to include the title as part of the attribution statement. \nHowever, if the title is provided, then Creative Commons encourages you \nto include it when attributing the author. \nFor more examples of how to mark your own work in different con -\ntexts, spend some time looking through Creative Commons\u2019 extensive \nmarking page \u201cMarking Your Work with a CC License\u201d (licensed CC BY \n4.0 and available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking  \n_your_work_with_a_CC_license). See the caption of figure 4.5 as an exam -\nple of marking an image with TASL information. It is a good example of \nCC marking because TASL with all appropriate links is provided in the \nattribution statement. \n2. Indicating if your work is based on someone else\u2019s work.  If your work is a \nmodification or adaptation of another work, you should indicate this and \nprovide attribution to the creator of the original work. You should also \ninclude a link to the work you modified and indicate what license applies \nto that work. Figure 4.6 is an example of this.\n3. Marking work created by others  that you are incorporating into your own \nwork. Figure 4.7 is an example here from a Saylor Academy course. - 68 -  CHaPter 4\nIn every case, the goals are the same: you want to make it easy for others to \nknow who created which parts of the work. To do this, you should (1) identify \nthe terms under which any given work, or part of a work, can be used, and (2) \nprovide information about the works you used to create your new work or that \nyou incorporated into your work.\nFinal Remarks\nWhen applying a CC license to a work, you should (1) use the CC license chooser  \nto determine which CC license best meets your needs. Apply the license code if \npossible, or copy and paste the text and links provided. (2) If you are using an \nonline platform, use the built-in CC license tools to mark your work with a CC \nlicense.

This makes it much easier for the public to understand how the \nlicenses work and what reusers have to do to meet their obligations.\nBut CC licenses do not apply to works in a vacuum. CC-licensed works usu -\nally live on websites that have their own terms of service. Or sometimes, these \nworks are not in formats that make it easy to reuse or adapt them. And the \nworks are often available in hard-copy form for a price.\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nHave you ever found a CC-licensed work that you weren\u2019t easily able to copy \nand share? What made it hard to reuse as intended? Was it an issue of technical \nformat, or were there access restrictions on the work, or something else? \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nCreative Commons licenses are standardized licenses, which means the terms \nand conditions are the same for all works subject to the same type of CC license. \nThis is an essential feature of their design, enabling the public to remix CC-  \nlicensed works. It also makes the licenses easy to understand.\nBut people and institutions that use the licenses have diverse needs and \nwants. Sometimes creators want slightly different terms rather than the stan -\ndard terms that CC licenses offer.\nCreative Commons strongly discourages people from customizing open \ncopyright licenses because this creates confusion, requires users to take the \ntime to learn about how the custom license differs, and eliminates the bene -\nfits of standardization. If you change any of the terms and conditions of a CC \nlicense, you cannot call it a Creative Commons license or otherwise use the CC \ntrademarks. This rule also applies if you try to add restrictions on what people \ncan do with CC-licensed work through your separate agreements, such as web -\nsite terms of service. For example, your website\u2019s terms of service can\u2019t tell peo -\nple they can\u2019t copy a CC-licensed work (if they are complying with the license \nterms). You can, however, make your CC-licensed work available on more per -\nmissive  terms and still call it a CC license. For example, you may waive your \nright to receive attribution. \nCreative Commons has a detailed legal policy , Modifying the CC Licenses, \n(licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/\nModifying_the_CC_licenses)  which outlines these rules. However, the best way \nto apply them is to ask yourself: \u201cIs what I want to do going to make it easier or UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 71 -\nharder for people to use my CC-licensed work?\u201d If the latter, then generally it\u2019s \na restriction and you can\u2019t do it unless you remove the Creative Commons name \nfrom the work.\nNote that all of the above applies to creators of CC-licensed work. You can \nnever change the legal terms that apply to someone else\u2019s CC-licensed work. \nCHARGING FOR A CC-LICENSED WORK\nThe first part of this section dealt with the requirements connected to changing \nthe legal terms on a CC-licensed work, whether by actually changing the license \nterms or using separate contracts to try to do so. \nBut what if you simply want to sell a CC-licensed work?\nIf you are the creator, then selling your work is always okay . In fact, selling \nphysical copies (e.g., a textbook) and providing digital copies for free is a very \ncommon method for making money while using CC licenses.\nFigure 4.8 highlights Cards Against Humanity , a card game available under \na Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 2.0 license. Cards Against Humanity offers their \ncards decks online for free download but sells physical copies.\nCharging for access to digital  copies of a CC-licensed work is more difficult. It \nis permissible, but once someone pays for a copy of your work, they can legally \ndistribute it to others for free under the terms of the applicable CC license.\nFIGURE 4.8  Stack of Cards Against Humanity packs\nPhoto from Flickr: flickr.com/photos/jareed/9669594018/\nAuthor: jareed  |  CC BY 2.0  |  Desaturated from original- 72 -  CHaPter 4\nIf you are charging for access to someone else\u2019s CC-licensed work\u2014whether a \nphysical copy or digital version\u2014you have to pay attention to the particular CC \nlicense applied to the work. If the CC license includes the NonCommercial (NC) \nrestriction, then you cannot charge the public to access the work.\nMAKING YOUR WORK ACCESSIBLE\nFormats: Simply applying a CC license to a creative work does not necessarily \nmake it easy for others to reuse and remix it. Think about what technical for -\nmat you are using for your content (e.g., PDF or MP3). Can people download \nyour work? Can they easily edit or remix it if the license allows? In addition \nto the final polished version, many creators distribute editable source files of \ntheir content to make it easier for those who want to use the work for their own \npurposes. For example, in addition to the physical book or e-book, you might \nwant to distribute files of a CC-licensed book that enable people to easily cut and \npaste the content into their own works.\nDRM: Using a distribution platform that applies digital rights management \n(DRM), such as copy protection technology , to your work is another way you \ncan inadvertently make it very hard for reusers to make use of the permissions \nin the CC license. If you have to upload your CC-licensed works to a platform \nthat uses DRM, you should consider also distributing the same content on sites \nthat do not use DRM.\nNote that the CC licenses prohibit you from applying DRM to someone else\u2019s \nCC-licensed work without their permission.\nWHAT IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT THE CC LICENSE?\nInevitably , there are creators who apply a CC license to a work and then later \ndecide they want to offer that work on different terms. Even though the original \nlicense cannot be revoked, the creator is free to also  offer the work under a dif -\nferent license. Similarly , the creator is free to remove the copy of the work that \nthey placed online. \nIn these cases, anyone who finds the work under the original license is \nlegally permitted to use it under those terms until the copyright expires. But as \na practical matter, reusers may want to comply with the creator\u2019s new wishes as \na matter of respect. UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 73 -\nWHAT IF SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING WITH MY CC-LICENSED WORK  \nI DON\u2019T LIKE?\nAs long as users abide by the license terms and conditions, authors/licensors \ncannot control how their material is used. That said, all CC licenses provide sev -\neral mechanisms that allow licensors to choose not to be associated with their \nmaterial, or to uses of their material with which they disagree.\n\u2022 First, all CC licenses prohibit using the attribution requirement to sug -\ngest that the licensor endorses or supports a particular use . \n\u2022 Second, licensors may waive the attribution requirement, choosing not to \nbe identified as the licensor, if they wish. \n\u2022 Third, if the licensor does not like how the material has been modified or \nused, CC licenses require that the licensee remove the attribution informa -\ntion upon request. (In Version 3.0 and earlier, this is only a requirement \nfor adaptations and collections; in 4.0, this also applies to the unmodified \nwork.) \n\u2022 Finally , anyone modifying licensed material must indicate that the \noriginal has been modified. This ensures that changes made to the orig -\ninal material\u2014whether or not the licensor approves of them\u2014are not \nattributed back to the licensor.\n\u2022 Furthermore, it is important to remember that:\n \u00bbThe Commons is full of good people who want to do the right thing, \nso we rarely see much \u201cabuse\u201d of openly licensed works. Using CC \nlicenses gives good, responsible people the freedom to use and \nbuild on your work.\n \u00bbCopyright and/or open copyright licenses don\u2019t keep \u201cbad\u201d people \nfrom doing \u201cbad\u201d things with your work if they don\u2019t care about \ncopyright in the first place.\nLEGAL CASES: OPEN EDUCATION\nIn the sixteen years since our licenses were first published, the number of law -\nsuits turning on the interpretation of a CC license has been extremely low, espe -\ncially considering that more than  1.6 billion CC-licensed works are available on \nthe Internet. CC licenses have fared incredibly well in court, and disputes are \nrare when compared to the number of lawsuits between the parties to privately \nnegotiated, custom licenses.1- 74 -  CHaPter 4\nIn 2017\u221218 there were three legal cases that involved CC licenses: Great Minds \nvs. FedEx Office , Great Minds vs. Office Depot , and Philpot vs. Media Research \nCenter . The outcomes of the court decisions for these three cases favored the \nenforceability of CC licenses and their role in enabling the sharing of content \nwith the public.\nGreat Minds vs. FedEx Office and Great Minds vs. Office Depot\nTwo of the three cases were raised by Great Minds, a curriculum developer.2 In \nthese two cases, Great Minds received public funding from New York State to \ndevelop OER (open educational resources) for school districts, which the orga -\nnization licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. Great Minds brought the court cases \nagainst commercial copy shops that were hired by school districts to reproduce \nNC-licensed OER. The OER were for school use, which qualified as a noncom -\nmercial purpose. \nGreat Minds made a common assertion in both cases: school districts are not \nallowed to outsource the reproduction of educational materials licensed under  \nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 to contractors (the contractors were the commercial print \nshops in these cases) that make a profit on those reproductions. Great Minds\u2019 \ntheory was that it was lawful for a school district employee to go to a copy shop \nand pay to use their copiers; however, if the same school employee paid the copy \nshop to hit \u201c PRINT \u201d instead, the copy shop is no longer working on behalf of, or \nunder the direction of the school district\u2014but is instead acting independently; \ntherefore, the copy shop has to directly rely on its own  NC license to make and \ncharge a fee for the very same copies.\nBecause they had applied a noncommercial license to their OER, Great Minds \nclaimed that the school districts working with the OER were not allowed to \nengage FedEx or Office Depot to reproduce the materials, and that because the \ncopy shops had made a profit, they had violated the license. Importantly , Great \nMinds never alleged that the school districts\u2019 use of the reproduced materials \nviolated the noncommercial restriction of the license. \nThe central question in both cases was whether a licensee (a school district \nthat is properly using the work for noncommercial purposes) may outsource \nthe reproduction of the works to another entity that makes a profit on those \nreproductions, without the entity it pays becoming a copyright infringer under \nthe NC license.UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 75 -\nIn both cases, the district courts agreed with the copy shop and found that no \ncopyright infringement or violation of the CC license had occurred. For addi -\ntional details on the court cases, see the Additional Resources  section at the end \nof this chapter.\nPhilpot vs. Media Research Center\nThe third case, Philpot vs. Media Research Center , Inc. ,3 involved Larry Phil -\npot, who voluntarily shared two photographs on Wikimedia under a Creative \nCommons license. Philpot  complained that Media Research Center (MRC) had \ninfringed his copyrights when it published his photographs in articles without  \nattribution. \nFollowing discovery (the phase of litigation during which factual evidence \nis gathered), MRC filed a  motion for a summary judgment asking the court to \nfind that it had not infringed Philpot\u2019s copyrights because it used the photos \nfor purposes of news and commentary , and those uses constitute fair use under \nU.S. copyright law.\nIn its  decision granting the motion for summary judgment, the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia rejected Philpot\u2019s argument that \na \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d had to occur before the CC license used by Philpot \napplied. \nThe district court ultimately found that MRC\u2019s uses of the two photographs \nconstituted fair use under U.S. copyright law, and as a result MRC had not vio -\nlated Philpot\u2019s copyrights. The court concluded that because fair use applied, \nattribution under the CC license was not required, and so MRC had not infringed \nPhilpot\u2019s copyrights. Compliance with the license had not been violated because \na copyright license does not apply where fair use applies. \nFair use eliminates the need to rely on or comply with a CC license. This is the \ncore design of all CC licenses\u2014CC licenses grant permission when permission \nis required under copyright law. They communicate the licensor\u2019s intention to \ngrant permission where permission is needed. And CC licenses are designed to \nbe effective and enforceable without necessarily meeting the requirements of a \ncontract. The law of contracts or obligations varies around the world, and there \nare some legal systems that may treat CC licenses as enforceable under the law \nof obligations. This court correctly determined that under U.S. law the licenses \neffectively grant permission without needing to meet the formal requirements \nof a contract because the intention to grant permission is all that is needed.- 76 -  CHaPter 4\nFinal Remarks\nSharing your content using Creative Commons licenses is generous, but that \nalone is not enough to make it easy for others to reuse and remix your work. \nYou should spend some time thinking from the perspective of someone who \nfinds your shared content. How easy is it for them to download, reuse, and \nrevise it? Are there legal or technical obstacles that make it difficult for them to \ndo the things the CC license is designed to allow? \n4.3  |   FINDING AND REUSING CC-LICENSED WORKS\nThe \u201cknowledge commons\u201d of CC-licensed and public domain works is a plenti -\nful resource that is available to all of us. But when you draw from it, remember \nto give credit to the creator and follow the other relevant license terms. \nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Search for and discover CC-licensed works \n\u2022 Give proper attribution when reusing CC-licensed works\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS \nThere are more than a billion CC-licensed works on the web. How do you find \nwhat might be useful to you? And once you do, what do you need to do when you \nreuse it? \nThere are several different ways to go about discovering CC-licensed works. \nSearch engines can help you search across the web, or you can target particular \nplatforms or sites. When you find a work to reuse, the most important thing to \ndo is provide proper attribution to the work\u2019 s licensor. \nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nThink about a few of the CC-licensed works you have seen or interacted with. \nHow did you find them? Did you know how to attribute the author if you shared \nthe work? \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nWhen you are seeking CC-licensed works to reuse, there are several strate -\ngies to consider. One good starting point is CC Search (https://search.creative  UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 77 -\ncommons.org/), which is a tool that lets you search twelve major repositories \nof CC content online. Creative Commons is currently working on a project to \nimprove the search tools it offers to help people discover works in the commons. \nCheck out the prototype of a new version of CC S earch  at (https://ccsearch.  \ncreativecommons.org/), which lets you create and save lists of works you like \nand includes a tool that enables you to give attribution with a single click.\nThese search tools only scratch the surface of what is in the commons. Many \nplatforms that enable the CC licensing of works shared on their sites also have \ntheir own search filters to find CC content, like OER Commons.\nIf there is a particular type of content you\u2019re looking for, you may be able \nto narrow down particular sources to explore. Wikipedia  offers a fairly com -\nprehensive listing (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0) of many major sources of CC mate -\nrial across various domains at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major  \n_Creative_Commons_licensed_works.\nYou can also search for works under a particular CC license. Take a look at \nthe Creative Commons overview of each license that includes examples of pro-\njects and people using those licenses:\n\u2022 You can find examples of use organized by CC license at https://creative  \ncommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/licensing  \n-examples/.\n\u2022 You can find examples of works placed into the public domain using CC0 \nat https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/.\nREUSING CC CONTENT\nWhen you find a CC work you want to reuse, the single most important thing \nto know is how to provide attribution. All CC licenses require that attribution be \ngiven to the creator .  (Remember that unlike the CC licenses, CC0 is not a license \nbut a Public Domain Dedication tool, so it does not require attribution in its \nterms. Nevertheless, giving credit or citing the source is typically considered \nbest practice even when not legally required.)\nThe elements of attribution are simple, though generally speaking, the \nmore information you can provide, the better. People like to understand where \nCC-licensed works come from, and creators like to know that their names will \nremain attached to their works. If an author has provided extensive informa -\ntion in their attribution notice, you should retain it where possible. - 78 -  CHaPter 4\nAs mentioned in section 4.1, the best practice for attribution is applying the \nTASL approach. \nT = Title\nA = Author\nS = Source\nL = License\nThe attribution requirements in the CC licenses are purposely designed to \nbe fairly flexible in order to account for the many ways content is used. A film -\nmaker will have different options for giving credit than a scientist publishing \nan academic paper. Explore the CC wiki page \u201cBest Practices for Attribution \u201d \n(licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/\nBest_practices_for_attribution ). Among the options listed, think about how you \nwould prefer to be attributed for your own work.\nCreative Commons is also exploring ways to automate attribution. Explore \nthis feature by going to the CC search tool (https://ccsearch.creativecommons  \n.org) and searching for \u201cgolden retrievers. \u201d Then, click on a couple of different \nphotos to see how attribution is given, and experiment with the \u201ccopy credit as \ntext\u201d and \u201ccopy credit as HTML\u201d functions. \nThe other main consideration when copying works (as opposed to remixing, \nwhich will be covered in the next section of this chapter) is the NonCommer -\ncial restriction. If the work you are using is published with one of the three CC \nlicenses that includes the NC element, then you need to make sure that you\u2019re \nnot using it for a commercial purpose . \nRemember, you can always reach out to the creator if you want to request \nextra permission beyond what the license allows. \nFinal Remarks\nAttribution is arguably the single most important aspect of Creative Commons \nlicensing. Think about why you want credit for your own work, even when it \nmay not be legally required. What value does attribution provide to authors, \nand to the public who comes across the work online?UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 79 -\n4.4  |   REMIXING CC-LICENSED WORKS\nCombining and adapting CC-licensed works is where things can get a little \ntricky . This section will give you the tools you need. \nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Describe the basics of what it means to create an adaptation\n\u2022 Explain the scope of the ShareAlike clause\n\u2022 Explain the scope of the NoDerivatives clause\n\u2022 Identify what license compatibility  means and how to determine whether \nlicenses are compatible \nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nThe great promise of Creative Commons licensing is that it increases the pool of \ncontent from which we can draw to create new works. But to take advantage of \nthis potential, you have to understand when and how you can incorporate and \nadapt CC-licensed works. This requires careful attention to the particular CC \nlicenses that apply , as well as a working understanding of the legal concept of \nadaptations as a matter of copyright.\nPersonal Reflection: Why It Matters to You\nHave you ever wondered how to use a CC-licensed work created by someone else \nin something you are creating? Have you ever come across a CC-licensed work \nyou wanted to reuse, but were unsure about whether doing so would require \nyou to apply a ShareAlike license to what you created?\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nCopying a CC-licensed work and sharing it is pretty simple. Just make sure to \nprovide attribution and refrain from using the work for commercial purposes \nif it is licensed with one of the NonCommercial licenses. \nBut what if you are changing a CC-licensed work or incorporating it into a \nnew work? First, remember that if your use of someone else\u2019s CC-licensed work \nfalls under an exception or limitation to copyright (like fair use or fair dealing), \nthen you have no obligations under the CC license. But if that is not the case, \nthen you need to rely on the CC license for permission to adapt the work. The \nthreshold question then becomes, is what you are doing creating an adaptation?  - 80 -  CHaPter 4\nAn \u201c adaptation \u201d (or a \u201cderivative work, \u201d as it is called in some parts of the \nworld) is a special term in copyright law.4 It means a \u201cmodified\u201d or \u201ctrans -\nformed\u201d work that has been created from a copyrighted work and that is suffi -\nciently original to itself to be protected by copyright. (It can thus be regarded as \na \u201cnew\u201d work.) Whether a transformed work differs sufficiently from the orig -\ninal work to be called an \u201c adaptation \u201d is not always easy to determine, though \nsome bright lines do exist. Read the explanation on the Creative Commons site \nat https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-an-adaptation  about what con -\nstitutes an adaptation. Some examples of adaptations include a film based on a \nnovel and a translation of a book from one language into another. \nKeep in mind that not all changes to a work result in the creation of an adap -\ntation\u2014such as spelling corrections. Also remember that to constitute an adap -\ntation, the resulting work must be considered based on  or derived from  the orig -\ninal. This means that if you use a few lines from a poem to illustrate a poetry \ntechnique in an article you\u2019re writing, your article is not an adaptation because \nyour article is not derived from or based on the poem from which you took a few \nlines. However, if you rearranged the stanzas in the poem and added new lines, \nthen almost certainly the resulting work would be considered an adaptation.\nHere are some particular types of adaptations to consider (some of them \nshould be familiar from earlier sections of this book): \n\u2022 Taking excerpts of a larger work.

Read the relevant FAQ at https://creativecommons  \n.org/faq/#when-is-my-use-considered-an-adaptation. \nFundamental principle \nAs of Version 4.0, all CC licenses, even the NoDerivatives licenses, allow anyone to make an \nadaptation of a CC-licensed work. The difference between ND licenses and the other licenses \nis that if an adaptation of an ND-licensed work has been created, it cannot be shared with \nothers. So an individual can create adaptations of an ND-licensed work, but he/she is not \nallowed to share these with others, including the learners at an educational institution.UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 81 -\nIf your reuse of a CC-licensed work does not create an adaptation , then \n\u2022 you are not required to apply a ShareAlike-license to your overall work \nif you are using an SA-licensed work within it; \n\u2022 the ND restriction does not prevent you from using an ND-licensed \nwork; and\n\u2022 you can combine that CC-licensed material with other work as long as you \nattribute and comply with the NonCommercial restriction if it applies.\nIf your reuse of a CC-licensed work does create an adaptation , then there are \nlimits on whether and how you may share the adapted work. We will look at \nthose next. But first, a note about collections of materials. \nADAPTATIONS AND REMIXES VS. COLLECTIONS\nIntroductory note:  The distinction between adaptations and collections is one \nof the trickiest concepts in copyright law. While there are many situations in \nwhich the differences are clear, there are also several ambiguous scenarios. \nThe distinction between adaptations and remixes is even less clear; it varies \nby jurisdiction, and even within a given jurisdiction, a judge\u2019s determination \nbetween the two can be subjective, since there are few definitive rules on which \nto rely . \nIn contrast to an adaptation or remix, a collection involves the assembly of \nseparate and independent creative works into a collective whole. A collection \nis not  an adaptation.  One community member likened the difference between \nadaptations and collections to smoothies and TV dinners, respectively: \n1. Like a smoothie (figure 4.9), an adaptation or remix  mixes material from \ndifferent sources to create a wholly new work.\nIn an adaptation or remix (and a smoothie), you often cannot tell where \none constituent work ends and another one begins. While this flexibility \nis useful for the new creator, it is still important to provide attribution to \nthe individual parts that went into making the adaptation.\nAn example of an educational adaptation would be an open textbook \nchapter that weaves together multiple OER in such a way that the reader \ncan\u2019t tell which resource was used on which page. That said, the endnotes \nof the book chapter should still provide attribution to all of the sources \nthat were remixed in the chapter.- 82 -  CHaPter 4\n2. Like a TV dinner (figure 4.10), a collection  groups different works \ntogether; however, a collection keeps them organized as distinct and sep -\narate objects. An example of a collection would be a book that consists of \na group of essays from different sources, or by different authors.\nWhen you create a collection, you must provide attribution and \nlicensing information about each of the individual works in that collec -\ntion. This gives the public the information they need to understand who \ncreated what and which license terms apply to specific content. You can \nrevisit section 4.1 \u201cChoosing and Applying a CC License\u201d to learn how \nto properly indicate the copyright status of third-party works that you \nincorporate into your new work.\nWhen you combine material into a collection, you may have a separate  \ncopyright of your own that you may license. However, your copyright \nFIGURE 4.9 CC Smoothie\nAuthor: Nate Angell  |  CC BY \nDerivative of \u201cStrawberry Smoothie \non Glass Jar\u201d by Element5  \n(pexels.com/photo/strawberry  \n-smoothie-on-glass-jar-775032/) \nin the public domain, and various \nCreative Commons license icons \nby Creative Commons ( https://\ncreativecommons.org/about/\ndownloads ) used under CC BY.\nDesaturated from original\nFIGURE 4.10 CC TV Dinner\nAuthor: Nate Angell  |  CC BY\nDerivative of \u201ctv dinner 1\u201d by adrigu \n(https://flic.kr/p/6AMLDF ) under CC \nBY, and various Creative Commons \nlicense icons by Creative Commons \n(https://creativecommons.org/about/\ndownloads ) used under CC BY .\nDesaturated from originalUsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 83 -\nonly extends to the new contributions that you made to the work. In a \ncollection, this is the selection and arrangement of the various works in \nthe collection, and not the individual works themselves. For example, \nyou can select and arrange pre-existing poems published by others into \nan anthology , write an introduction, and design a cover for the collec -\ntion, but your copyright and the only copyright you can license extends \nto your arrangement of the poems (not the poems themselves), and your \noriginal introduction and cover. The poems are not yours to license. \nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CREATE AN ADAPTATION  \nOF A CC-LICENSED WORK OR WORKS?  \nGeneral rules\n\u2022 If the underlying work is licensed under a NoDerivatives license, you can \nmake and use changes privately , but you cannot share your adaptation \nwith others, as discussed above.\n\u2022 If the underlying or original work is licensed under a ShareAlike license, then \nShareAlike applies to your adaptation of it, and you must license the adapta -\ntion under the same or a compatible license. There is more on this below.\n\u2022 You need to consider license compatibility . License compatibility  is the \nterm used to address the issue of which types of licensed works can be \nadapted into a new work.\n\u2022  In all cases, you have to attribute the original work when you create an \nadaptation.\nScenarios\nWhen creating an adaptation of a CC-licensed work, the simplest scenario is \nwhen you take a single CC-licensed work and adapt it. \nThe more complicated scenario is when you are adapting two or more CC-  \nlicensed works into a new work.\nIn both situations, you need to consider what options you have for licensing \nthe copyright you have in your adaptation; this is called the Adapter\u2019s License.  \nRemember that your rights in your adaptation only apply to your own contri -\nbutions. The original license continues to govern the reuse of the elements from \nthe original work that you used when creating your adaptation. The \u201cCC Adapt -\ners License Chart, \u201d shown in figure 4.11, may be a helpful guide. When creating \nan adaptation of material under the license identified in the left-hand column, \nyou may license your contributions to the adaptation under one of the licenses \nindicated on the top row if the corresponding box is dark gray . Creative Com -- 84 -  CHaPter 4\nmons does not recommend using a license if the corresponding box is white, \nalthough doing so is technically permitted by the terms of the license. If you do, \nyou should take additional care to mark the adaptation as involving multiple \ncopyrights under different terms, so that downstream users are aware of their \nobligations to comply with the licenses from all rights holders. The light gray \nboxes indicate those licenses that you may not use as your adapter\u2019s license.\nHOW TO PICK YOUR ADAPTER\u2019S LICENSE\nIf the underlying work is licensed with BY or BY-NC, we recommend that your \nadapter\u2019s license include at least the same license elements as the license \napplied to the original. For example, if one adapts a BY-NC work, she will apply \nBY-NC to her adaptation. If one adapts a BY work, she could apply either BY or \nBY-NC to her adaptation.\nIf the underlying work is licensed with BY-SA or BY-NC-SA, your adapter\u2019s \nlicense must be the same license applied to the original or a license that is desig -\nnated as compatible to the original license. We\u2019ll discuss license compatibility \nin more detail below. \nRemember, if the underlying work is licensed with BY-ND or BY-NC-ND, you \ncannot distribute adaptations, so you don\u2019t need to be concerned about what \nadapter\u2019s license to apply .\nFIGURE 4.11 CC adapter\u2019s license chart\nFigure from Creative Commons: https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-combine-material  \n-under-different-creative-commons-licenses-in-my-work\nCC BY 4.0   |  Desaturated from originalUsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 85 -\nUNDERSTANDING LICENSE COMPATIBILITY\nWhen people talk about licenses being \u201ccompatible, \u201d they can be referring to \nseveral different situations.\nOne type of license compatibility involves the question of what licenses you \ncan use for your adapter\u2019s license when you adapt a work. This is what we dis -\ncussed above. For example, BY-NC is compatible with BY , in the sense that one \ncan adapt a BY work and use BY-NC on her adaptation. \nBy definition, the ShareAlike licenses have very few compatible licenses. All \nSA licenses after Version 1.0 allow you to use a later version of the same license \non your adaptation. For example, if you remix a BY-SA 2.0 work, you can, and \nshould, apply BY-SA 4.0 to your adaptation. There are also a small number of \nnon-CC licenses that have been designated as CC Compatible Licenses for Share-  \nAlike purposes. You can read more about this at https://creativecommons.org/\nshare-your-work/licensing-considerations/compatible-licenses.\nAnother type of license compatibility relates to what licenses are compatible \nwhen adapting (more commonly referred to as \u201cremixing\u201d in this context) more \nthan one pre-existing work. The remix chart in figure 4.12 may be a helpful \nguide in these circumstances. To use the chart, find a license that applies to one \nof the works on the left-hand column and the license that applies to the other \nFIGURE 4.12 CC License Compatibility Chart \nFigure from Creative Commons: https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-combine-material  \n-under-different-creative-commons-licenses-in-my-work\nCC BY 4.0  |  Destaurated from original- 86 -  CHaPter 4\nwork on the top right row. If there is a checkmark in the box where that row and \ncolumn intersect, then the works under those two licenses can be remixed. If \nthere is an \u201cX\u201d in the box, then the works may not be remixed unless an excep -\ntion or limitation applies. \nWhen using the chart, you can determine which license to use for your adap -\ntation by choosing the more restrictive of the two licenses on the works you\u2019re \ncombining. While this technically isn\u2019t your only option for your adapter\u2019s \nlicense, it is best practice because it eases reuse for downstream users. \nFinal Remarks\nIt can be intimidating to approach remixing in a way that is consistent with \ncopyright. In this section, hopefully you gained some tools for how to approach \nthe task. The threshold question is whether an adaptation under copyright is \ncreated. Once that is answered, you have the information you need to deter -\nmine what works from the commons you can incorporate into your work.\n4.5  |   ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nAdditional Details on the Court Cases in Section 4.2  \n\u201cThings to Consider after CC Licensing\u201d\nIn the FedEx Office  case, the decision was affirmed by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court \nof Appeals, which stated: \u201cIn sum, the unambiguous terms of License permit \nFedEx to copy the Materials on behalf of a school district exercising rights under \nthe License and charge that district for that copying at a rate more than FedEx\u2019s \ncost, in the absence of any claim that the school district is using the Materials \nfor other than a \u2018non-Commercial purpose. \u2019 The motion to dismiss is granted. \u201d \nWith the Office Depot  case, Great Minds claimed that the copy store had vio -\nlated the BY-NC-SA 4.0 license for the same reasons FedEx Office did; however, \nGreat Minds also claimed that because Office Depot had reached out to school \ndistricts to solicit reproduction orders, the solicitation was additional evidence \nof a license violation. The other difference with the FedEx  Office  case was that \nGreat Minds and Office Depot had entered into a contract specifying that Office \nDepot could reproduce the same publicly funded educational materials for \nschool districts and would pay royalties to Great Minds.5 \nThe U.S. District Court for the Central District of California agreed with \nOffice Depot, stating that it \u201cconcludes that the Creative Commons Public \nLicense unambiguously grants the licensee schools and school districts the UsIng CC LICenses and CC-LICensed Works  - 87 -\nright \u2018to reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for \nNonCommercial purposes only , \u2019 and does not prohibit the schools and school \ndistricts from employing third parties, such as Office Depot, to make copies of \nthe Materials. . . . Because the schools and school districts are the entities exer -\ncising the rights granted under the Creative Commons Public License, it is irrel -\nevant that Office Depot may have profited from making copies for schools and \nschool districts. \u201d \nFurthermore, the district court stated: \u201cThe Creative Commons Public \nLicense at issue authorizes schools to: (1) reproduce and use the Materials for \nNonCommercial purposes, (2) expressly permits the schools to provide those \nMaterials to the public \u2018by any means or process, \u2019 and (3) does not prohibit the \nschools from outsourcing the copying to third-party vendors. Because a licensee \nmay lawfully use a third-party agent or contractor to assist it in exercising its \nlicensed rights, absent contractual provisions prohibiting such activity, Great \nMinds has failed to allege that Office Depot\u2019s conduct was outside the scope of \nthe license and, thus, Great Minds\u2019 claim for copyright infringement against \nOffice Depot fails. \u201d The court also addressed Office Depot\u2019s alleged solicitation \nof school districts\u2019 reproduction business.

Open Access literature is digital, \nonline, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. \nOpen Access stands in contrast to the existing \u201cclosed\u201d system for communi -\ncating scientific and scholarly research. This system is slow, expensive, and \nill-suited for research collaboration and discovery . And even though scholarly \nresearch is largely produced as a result of public funding, the results are often \nhidden behind technical, legal, and financial barriers or paywalls. Open Access \npublishing is an alternative model\u2014one that takes full advantage of digital  \ntechnologies, the web, and open licensing to provide free access to scholarship.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Define Open Access\n\u2022 Explain the benefits of Open Access for your learners and for  \nresearchers at your institution \n\u2022 Understand how authors and researchers can make their own  \nworks Open Access\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nThe purpose of scientific inquiry at a university is the fundamental search for \nknowledge. Teaching, the open exchange of ideas, and the process of publishing \noriginal research are all methods by which academic faculty , learners, staff, and \nothers contribute to advancing scholarship. \nHow well do the current practices of accessing and sharing information \nwithin the university system reflect and support the stated goals of research \nand scholarship? \nThis chapter will explore how the practice of Open Access publishing aligns \nwith the goals of improving access to knowledge, and how librarians can  \nsupport colleges and universities in implementing Open Access practices and  \npolicies.

How do you interact with learners and faculty who are searching for \nacademic research? Have you ever encountered a paywall while trying to access \nresearch articles?\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nSCHOLARLY PUBLISHING TODAY\nTo get an overview of the topic, you should first read the Wikipedia  article on \n\u201cScholarly Communication\u201d (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 and available at https://\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_communication ). This article defines schol -\narly communication as \u201cthe system through which research and other scholarly \nwritings are created, evaluated for quality , disseminated to the scholarly com -\nmunity , and preserved for future use. The system includes both formal means \nof communication, such as publication in peer-reviewed journals, and informal \nchannels, such as electronic listservs. \u201d \nThe challenges with the existing approach to scholarly communications are \nlaid out in the graphic in figure 5.1. This image explains\u2014in generalized terms\u2014\nthe current process involved with developing and communicating scientific \nresults. In the first step of the life cycle, scientists, academics, and research \nFIGURE 5.1 Current funding cycle for research articles\nFigure from Creative Commons Wiki: https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/File:Research  \n_articles_cycles.jpg\nAuthor: Billymeinke  |  CC BY 4.0  |  Cropped and desaturated from original\n- 94 -  CHaPter 5\ninstitutions seek funds to conduct a variety of research. Most often this fund -\ning comes from government sources (e.g., the National Institutes of Health in \nthe United States), although there are several philanthropic foundations (such \nas the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) that are now making major investments \nin particular types of research.   \nAfter the researchers have secured their grants, they conduct their experi -\nments and collect their data. Most of the time these researchers prepare their \nresults in the form of an academic article, which they then submit to a scholarly \njournal for publication. The journals then arrange for some of the submitted \narticles to undergo a process of peer review, in which experts within that par -\nticular topic or field will read, review, and usually provide comments on the \nsubmitted paper. \nSome of the articles that pass the peer review stage are then offered for publi -\ncation in the journal. The journal will notify the author that her paper has been \naccepted, and usually require that the author transfer copyright in the article \nto (or agree to an exclusive publishing contract with) the journal. By accepting \nthese terms, the author has granted to the journal her exclusive rights under \ncopyright. This means that the journal\u2014and not the author\u2014is now the copy -\nright holder of the article, and so the journal  may restrict the terms of access \nand reuse provided for by the bundle of rights granted to rights holders under \nthe law. \nBecause journals have become the de facto rights holders to the articles in \nwhich new scientific research is published, they are also in a position to license \naccess to these materials to university libraries, research institutions, and the \npublic\u2014typically for a significant fee. This leads to a cyclical situation in which \nfor-profit publishers essentially sell back access to the scientific and scholarly \nrecord that academics originally produced through public grants. \nEven after a publishing embargo (usually a time of six months to a year, \nduring which the publishers retain exclusive publishing rights) expires, access \nto the mostly publicly funded scientific research remains limited, with users \nonly permitted to read those articles if they are properly submitted to institu -\ntional repositories. In the end, the public is left with restricted access to the pub -\nlicly funded scholarly record, and progress in the scientific enterprise doesn\u2019t \nreach its maximum potential. \nThere are several critiques of the existing academic publishing system. \nSPARC has a summary of their key points on its \u201cOpen Access\u201d page (licensed CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 95 -\nCC BY 4.0, available at https://sparcopen.org/open-access/ ), some highlights of \nwhich are given below: \n\u2022 Governments provide most of the funding for research\u2014many billions \nof dollars annually\u2014and public institutions employ a large portion of all \nresearchers.\n\u2022 Researchers publish their findings without the expectation of compensa -\ntion. Unlike other authors, they hand their work over to publishers with -\nout payment, in the interest of advancing human knowledge.\n\u2022 Through the process of peer review, researchers review each other\u2019s \nwork for free.\n\u2022 Once published, those that contributed to the research (from taxpayers to \nthe institutions that supported the research itself ) have to pay again to \naccess the findings. Though research is produced as a public good, it isn\u2019t \navailable to the public who paid for it. (2007-2017 SPARC, CC BY)\nAs ever-increasing journal prices outpace library budgets, academic librar -\nies are forced to make difficult decisions\u2014often having to cancel subscriptions \nor shift money away from other budget items. According to the Association \nof Research Libraries (ARL), the average cost of a serial subscription for ARL \nmember libraries increased  by 315 percent from 1986 to 2003.1 Since 2003, aver -\nage journal prices have increased more slowly , but they\u2019ve still continued to \nrise about nine percent each year. \nOPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING\nThe \u201cclosed access\u201d publishing system limits the impact of the research pro -\nduced by the scientific and scholarly community and progress is thereby slowed \nsignificantly . By contrast, Open Access literature is defined  by the scholar Peter \nSuber as \u201cdigital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licens -\ning restrictions. \u201d2 The graphic in figure 5.2 provides a quick overview of how an \nopen-access publishing system works.\nIn contrast to figure 5.1, which explained the current costly and inefficient \nscience publishing life cycle, figure 5.2 explores an alternate path\u2014the open \naccess route. \nThe process begins just as it did in the explanation of the incumbent sys -\ntem\u2014with government requests for proposals (RFPs) for research. But instead \nof remaining silent on how the research results will be communicated, the RFPs - 96 -  CHaPter 5\ncontain policy language which requires that the published research be made \navailable on an open access basis.\nNext, researchers conduct their scientific experiments and prepare their \nacademic manuscripts. When they go to submit their articles to journals, they \nmust think about the Open-Access policy requirements they agreed upon when \nthey accepted their grant funding. This means that the researchers must retain \ntheir copyrights\u2014and not sign them over to for-profit publishers. Or instead, \nauthors must search out a \u201cGold\u201d open access journal, which publishes research \nunder liberal open-access licenses (like CC BY) at publication. In either case, \nauthors retain some\u2014or all\u2014rights to their research articles, permitting them \nto publish under open access licenses, and ensuring that they may deposit their \narticles in a university or institutional repository for long-term access and \npreservation. \nBy publishing under open access licenses like CC BY , downstream users are \ngranted the legal permissions to access and reuse the research. This type of \nFIGURE 5.2  Optimized funding cycle for research articles\nFigure from Creative Commons Wiki: https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/File:Research  \n_articles_cycles.jpg\nAuthor: Billymeinke  |  CC BY 4.0  |  Cropped and desaturated from original\nWatch the Open Access Explained!  video. https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY&t=124s   |  CC BY 3.0CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 97 -\nopen access system is better aligned with the original purpose of conducting \nscience and sharing results openly through the scholarly publishing process. In \nthe long run, the open access approach is more efficient, equitable, affordable, \nand collaborative.  \nOPEN ACCESS OPTIONS\nOpen Access authors have the opportunity to publish in a few ways. The most \ncommon are known as \u201cGreen\u201d and \u201cGold\u201d Open Access.\nGreen OA involves making a version of the article or manuscript freely \navailable in a repository . This is also known as self-archiving. An example of \nGreen OA is a university research repository . OA repositories can be organized \nby discipline (e.g., arXiv for physics) or institution (e.g., Knowledge@UChicago \nfor the University of Chicago).\nGold OA  involves making the final version of the manuscript freely available \nimmediately upon publication by the publisher, typically by publishing it in an \nOpen Access journal and making the article available under an open license. \nTypically , Open Access journals charge an article processing charge (APC) \nwhen an author wishes to (1) publish an article online allowing for free pub -\nlic access and (2) retain the copyright to the article. APCs range from zero to \nseveral thousand dollars per article.  You can read more about APCs on Wikipe -\ndia \u2019s \u201cArticle Processing Charge\u201d (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 and available  at https:/ /\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Article_processing_charge ). An example of a Gold OA jour -\nnal is PLOS Biology , one of several scientific journals put out by the nonprofit \npublisher PLOS (Public Library of Science). \nThe Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ; https://doaj.org/) is a site that \nindexes open access journals, and HowOpenIsIt?  (licensed CC BY 4.0, available \nat https://sparcopen.org/our-work/howopenisit/) is a handy tool for evaluating \nthe relative \u201copenness\u201d of journals from fully open-access to closed-access. \n Certain emerging models like preprints and hubs are rapidly emerging, and \nthey can provide a new way of considering Open Access publishing outside of \nthe constraints of publisher-mediated models.\nEducating Authors about Their Publishing Rights\nBy understanding copyright and the various scholarly publishing options, \nlibrarians can help faculty members and graduate learners navigate the system \nas they publish research. - 98 -  CHaPter 5\nOften, scholarly publishers require authors to transfer their rights to pub -\nlishing companies before their research will be published in an academic jour -\nnal. Academic librarians and other library departments can support faculty \nand student authors by helping them understand what they give up when they \ntransfer their copyrights to a publisher. For example, scholarly authors who \ntransfer copyright could lose the ability to post their research on their own \nwebsites.  \nSeveral tools exist to help faculty and scholars understand their rights and \npublishing options, and to help them exercise those rights. The Termination of \nTransfer tool,3 co-stewarded by the Authors Alliance and Creative Commons, \ngives authors who have previously entered into publishing agreements infor -\nmation about whether and how they can regain the publication rights that they \npreviously assigned away so they can publish on new terms, including under \na CC license if they choose. The Scholars Copyright Addendum Engine4 can be \nused by faculty and other authors to amend publication agreements when they \nare submitting an article to a traditional publisher. The engine allows authors to \nchoose among different options to reserve rights for themselves and generates \nan agreement that is then submitted with a traditional publication agreement to \nmake that legally effective. Additionally , the Authors Alliance publishes myr -\niad resources about these tools and open access, and PLOS offers resources and \narticles about the benefits of open access as well.\nAcademic librarians can also help scholars understand how different pub -\nlishing options affect both the audience and the prestige of their work. The \n\u201cimpact factor\u201d is a primary metric of the prominence of a journal or publica -\ntion, measured by the number of times the average article in a particular jour -\nnal has been cited (in other sources) in one year. Because impact factors are not \nnecessarily a reliable metric of a journal\u2019s importance, some publishers like \nNature Research, the publisher of the prestigious scientific journal Nature , \nare reconsidering the importance of impact factors for journals. Many Open \nAccess scholars encourage systems like altmetrics  to provide another way of \nthinking about impact beyond the traditional metrics. In 2017 , Science  released \na study finding that on average, open access papers had a fifty percent higher \nresearch impact than strictly \u201cpaywalled\u201d papers.5 For more information, read \nJon Tennant\u2019s 2016 article (https://f1000research.com/articles/5-632/v1) on the \nacademic, societal, and economic advantages of open access.CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 99 -\nOpen Access Practices and Policies  \nat the University and Beyond\nAn open access policy is a formal policy adopted by an institution to support \nresearchers in making their work openly available. These policies can refer to \npublished peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and peer-reviewed drafts \nor pre-printed publications that are deposited in an institutional repository or \npublished under open-access terms in a journal. Open access policies gener -\nally define the guidelines for how researchers can disseminate their research \nin order to maximize access to them. The Registry of Open Access Repository  \nMandates and Policies (ROARMAP; https://roarmap.eprints.org) is a regis -\ntry that charts the open access policies or mandates adopted by universities, \nresearch institutions, and research funders that require or request their \nresearchers to provide open access to their peer-reviewed research article \noutput by depositing it in an institutional repository , or publish their research \nunder open-access terms in a journal.\nAccording to Peter Suber, an open access advocate, mandate is not the best \nword \u201c\u2018for open-access policies, \u2019 . . . but neither is any other English word. \u201d6  \nWithout a mandate, institutions can consider faculty opt-in policies, whereby \nlibraries or copyright offices focus on shifting the default publishing practice \nto open access.\nUNIVERSITY POLICIES\nMany universities have adopted open access policies that require university-  \naffiliated researchers to grant to their institution a non-exclusive license to \na scholarly article at the time of the creation of the work. This process heads \noff problems with publishers downstream, since the university retains a legal \nright to the work before copyright is transferred to a publisher. These policies \nhave proliferated under the assumption that universities themselves should \nbe able to access and preserve the research outputs of their faculty . To view \nan example, review the University of California Open Access Policy at https://\nosc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/. You can also view many \nother institutions\u2019 open-access policies on the ROARMAP  site (https://roarmap.\neprints.org), which has collected several hundred of these policies, including \nthose of universities, colleges, research organizations, and other academic \ninstitutions.  \nFor academic librarians who are interested in developing an open access \npolicy for their university or institution, the Harvard Open Access Project has - 100 -  CHaPter 5\ndeveloped a toolkit, licensed CC BY 3.0 and available at https://cyber.harvard.\nedu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies. Open Access pol -\nicies usually originate from an institution\u2019s Office of Scholarly Communica -\ntions, but librarians in a variety of roles (outreach, reference, etc.) can also help \ncraft these policies.\nPUBLIC POLICY\nIn addition to encouraging the development of open access policies at the uni -\nversity level, public policies can ensure that publicly funded research be made \navailable under Open Access terms. This typically is accomplished through the \ninclusion of sharing requirements that are tied to receiving government or \nphilanthropic grant funds. When funding cycles for research include deposit \nor open license requirements for publications, the resulting increased access \nand opportunities for reuse extend the value of that research funding. As \nan example, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy  \nrequires that \u201call investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for \nthem to the National Library of Medicine\u2019s PubMed Central an electronic ver -\nsion of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication, \nto be made publicly available no later than twelve months after the official date \nof publication. \u201d7\nThe Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act  (FASTR) was intro -\nduced repeatedly in both houses of Congress in the period from 2012 to 2017 , but \nit has yet to be approved. Should U.S. Congress approve FASTR, the bill would \nrequire federal agencies with annual extramural research budgets of $100 mil -\nlion or more to provide the public with online access to the research articles \nstemming from that funded research within six to twelve months after publica -\ntion in a peer-reviewed journal. The passage of FASTR would ensure that arti -\ncles based on publicly funded research are made freely available for all poten -\ntial users to read, and it would ensure that those articles can be fully used in the \ndigital environment, enabling the use of new computational analysis tools that \npromise to revolutionize the research process.\nOpen Access Myths Debunked\nFor faculty and learners alike, open access can seem like a scary new world, par -\nticularly since the pressure to publish has increased. There are many guides to \ndebunking the myths of open access publishing, and reading these carefully to \ndispel any fear or misunderstanding is crucial in the current academic landscape.CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 101 -\n\u2022 \u201cField Guide to Misunderstandings about Open Access, \u201d by Peter Suber, \nhttp://legacy .earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/04-02-09.htm#fieldguide\n\u2022 University of Minnesota, \u201cMyths about Open Access Publishing, \u201d https://\nwww.lib.umn.edu/openaccess/myths-about-open-access\n\u2022 \u201cPersistent Myths about Open Access Scientific Publishing, \u201d by Mike Taylor, \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/apr/17/persistent-myths  \n-open-access-scientific-publishing\nFinal Remarks\nUniversities play a major role in advancing scientific research, and academic \npublishing is a key mechanism for faculty to communicate their findings to col -\nleagues and the public. As organizers of knowledge within institutions, librar -\nians can work together with university researchers to promote access to infor -\nmation. They can do this by educating on the \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of open access, \nanswering questions about copyright, and providing guidance and recommen -\ndations to maximize the reach and impact of scholarly publishing in particular \nfields. \n5.2  |   OPEN PEDAGOGY AND PRACTICES\nOpenness in education brings the potential for co-creation and learning through \nactive participation in how knowledge is produced.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Explain how copyright restricts pedagogy\n\u2022 Define open pedagogy , open educational practices, and OER-enabled \npedagogy, and describe how open licensing enables each of these\n\u2022 List examples of open pedagogy in practice\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nDo you remember when smartphones were first released? They were full of \ninfinite possibilities compared to earlier phones. Before smartphones, we could \nonly call and text. But with smartphones, we can now take videos and pictures, \nplay movies and music, surf the web and read e-mail, and call and text. It was \ndifficult for long-time users of older phones to take advantage of all the capabil -\nities offered by the new phones. They were too accustomed to the limitations of \nolder phones. For months\u2014and sometimes years\u2014they used their smartphones \nonly to call and text.

These pedagogical capabilities are all about the \nteaching and learning practices and tools that empower learners and teachers \nto create and share knowledge openly and learn deeply .\nThree Definitions\nThe Open Education movement is still discussing and debating what it means \nto think about teaching and learning practices in a more inclusive, diverse, and \nopen manner.

And it\u2019s equally \nwell-established that copyright restricts people from engaging in a range of \nactivities. When juxtaposed like this, it becomes clear that copyright restricts \npedagogy by contracting the universe of things that learners and teachers can \ndo with education materials. If there are things that learners are not allowed to \ndo, this means there are ways that learners are not allowed to learn. If there are \nthings that teachers aren\u2019t allowed to do, this means there are ways that teach -\ners aren\u2019t allowed to teach. \nYou can learn about how these restrictions on what teachers and learners \ncan do impacts teaching and learning by reading the metaphor/blog post about \ndriving airplanes on roads at https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3761.\nExamples of Open Educational Practices,  \nOpen Pedagogy, and OER-Enabled Pedagogy\nOne of the foundational ideas of open teaching and learning practices is the dis -\ntinction between disposable and renewable assignments.\nDo you remember doing homework for school that felt utterly pointless? A \n\u201cdisposable assignment \u201d is an assignment that supports an individual student\u2019s \nlearning but adds no other value to the world\u2014the student spends hours work -\ning on it, the teacher spends time grading it, and the student gets it back and \nthen throws it away. While disposable assignments may promote learning by \nan individual student, these assignments can be demoralizing for people who \nwant to feel like their work matters beyond the immediate moment.\nIn contrast, \u201crenewable assignments\u201d are assignments that both support \nindividual student learning and add value to the broader world. With renew -\nable assignments, learners are asked to create and openly license valuable arti -\nfacts that, in addition to supporting their own learning, will be useful to other \nlearners both inside and outside the classroom. Classic renewable assignments \ninclude, for example, collaborating with learners to write new case studies for \ntextbooks, creating \u201cexplainer\u201d videos, and modifying learning materials that \nwill speak more directly to learners\u2019 local cultures and needs.\nTo explore additional examples of this pedagogical approach in action, check \nout the examples given by David Wiley in Project Management for Instruc -\ntional Designers (licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, available at http://pm4id.org/ ) and \nRobin DeRosa\u2019s Actualham website ( http://robinderosa.net/uncategorized/\nmy-open-textbook-pedagogy-and-practice/ ) of learners adapting existing mate -- 104 -  CHaPter 5\nrials to create new textbooks. In both of these cases, teachers had learners cre -\nate their own textbooks, which then had Creative Commons licenses applied \nto them. Other examples of OER-enabled pedagogy in action include assign -\nments by JB Murray (licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  \nWikipedia:WikiProject_Murder_Madness_and_Mayhem) and Amin Azzam \n(licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject  \n_Medicine/UCSF_Elective_2013 ) that had learners significantly improve articles \nthat were in Wikipedia . When they completed these assignments, the learners \nhad created open artifacts that were useful in both supporting their own learn -\ning and the learning of other learners and educators. In these examples, learn -\ners created assignments that allowed them to interact with the greater commu -\nnity and ensured that the assignments are renewable, not disposable, artifacts.  \nA couple of other interesting examples of renewable assignments are a \nremixed explainer video that a student made, entitled Blogs and Wikis: a ficti -\ntious debate  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsFU3sAlPx4 )  and the DS106 \nassignment bank (http://assignments.ds106.us/) which is a hub for student-  \ncreated, CC-licensed content. Additional examples are available on the Open \nPedagogy Notebook website (licensed CC BY 4.0 and available at http://open  \npedagogy.org/examples ). \nFinal Remarks\nIf you\u2019re just going to use your new smartphone the same way you used your \nold flip phone, there wasn\u2019t much point in getting a new phone. Likewise, when \nwe use OER to support learning in exactly the same ways that we used the old \n\u201call rights reserved\u201d materials, we may save learners money , but we miss out on \nthe transformative power of open pedagogy . As you prepare to use OER in your \nteaching, think about the new things that are possible in the context of permis -\nsion to engage in the 5R activities.\n5.3  |   OER, OPEN TEXTBOOKS, OPEN COURSES\nOpen Education is an idea, as well as a set of content, practices, policies, and \ncommunities which, when properly leveraged, can help everyone in the world \naccess free, effective, open learning materials at either zero or marginal cost.  \nWe live in an age of information abundance where everyone, for the first time \nin human history , can potentially attain all the education they desire. The key \nto this transformational shift  in learning is Open Educational Resources (OER). CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 105 -\nOER are educational materials that are shared at no cost, with legal permissions \nfor the public to freely use, share, and build upon their content.\nOER are possible because:\n\u2022 they are (mostly) born digital,8 and digital resources can be stored,  \ncopied, and distributed for near zero cost;\n\u2022 the Internet makes it simple for the public to share digital content; and\n\u2022 Creative Commons licenses make it simple and legal to retain copyright \nand legally share educational resources with the world.\nBecause we can share effective education materials with the world for near \nzero cost,9 many people argue that educators and governments which support \npublic education have a moral and ethical obligation to do so. After all, educa -\ntion is fundamentally about sharing knowledge and ideas. Creative Commons \nbelieves that OER will replace much of the expensive, proprietary content that \nis currently used in academic courses. Shifting to this open model will gener -\nate more equitable economic opportunities and social benefits globally without \nsacrificing the quality of educational content.\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nDoes it seem reasonable that education in the age of the Internet should be more \nexpensive and less flexible than it was in previous generations? Education is \nmore important than ever before; nothing else can do as much to promote the \nhappiness, prosperity , and security of individuals, families, and societies. \nWhile many interesting and useful experiments are occurring outside formal \neducation, the degrees, certificates, and other credentials awarded by formal \ninstitutions are still critically important to the quality of life of many people \naround the world .\nFormal education, even in the age of the Internet, can be more expensive and \nless flexible than ever. In many countries, the publishers of educational mate -\nrials overcharge for textbooks and other resources. As part of their transition \nfrom print to digital, these same companies have largely moved away from a \nmodel where learners purchase and own books to a \u201cstreaming\u201d model where \nthey have access to those resources for only a limited time. Furthermore, pub -\nlishers are constantly developing new restrictive technologies that limit what \nlearners and faculty can do with the resources they have temporary access to, \nincluding novel ways to prohibit printing, prevent cutting and pasting, and \nrestrict the sharing of materials between friends. - 106 -  CHaPter 5\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022\t Define the word open in the context of open educational resources\n\u2022\t Differentiate between OER, open textbooks, open courses, and MOOCs \n(massive open online courses)\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nWhat impacts have the rising costs and decreased flexibility of educational \nmaterials had on you and those you know? What role do you think that \u201call \nrights reserved\u201d copyrights and related laws have played in driving up costs \nand driving down flexibility for learners and teachers? \nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nOpen Educational Resources are teaching, learning, and research materials in \nany medium that reside in the public domain or have been released under an \nopen license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation, and redistribution by \nothers.10 Or we could use this less technical definition to describe OER: OER are \neducational materials that can be freely downloaded, edited, and shared to bet -\nter serve all students.11\nIn contrast to traditional educational materials, which are constantly becom -\ning more expensive and less flexible, OER give everyone, everywhere, free per -\nmission to download, edit, and share them with others. David Wiley provides \nanother popular definition, stating that only educational materials licensed in \na manner that provides the public with permission to engage in the 5R activities \ncan be considered OER. \nThe 5R permissions are:\n1. Retain \u2014permission to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., \ndownload, duplicate, store, and manage it)\n2. Reuse \u2014permission to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a \nclass, in a study group, on a website, in a video)\n3. Revise \u2014permission to adapt, adjust, modify , or alter the content itself \n(e.g., translate the content into another language)OER and Open Textbooks\nTo begin, you should watch the video Why OER?  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc2ovlU9Ndk   |  CC BY 3.0CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 107 -\n4. Remix \u2014permission to combine the original or revised content with \nother material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content \ninto a mashup)\n5. Redistribute \u2014permission to share copies of the original content, your \nrevisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy to a friend)\nThe easiest way to confirm that an educational resource is an \u201copen\u201d one that \nprovides you with the 5R permissions is to determine that the resource is either \nin the public domain or has been licensed under a Creative Commons license \nwhich permits the creation of derivative works; these licenses are CC BY , CC \nBY-SA, CC BY-NC, and CC BY-NC-SA.\nOpen educational resources come in all shapes and sizes. An OER can be \nas small as a single article, academic paper, video, or simulation, or it can be \nas large as an entire degree program. However, it can be difficult, or at least \ntime-consuming for teachers to assemble OER into a collection that is compre -\nhensive enough to replace an \u201call rights reserved\u201d copyrighted textbook. When \nOER are collected and presented in ways that resemble a traditional textbook, \nit often makes it easier for teachers to use the resources. The term open text -\nbook simply means a collection of OER that has been organized to look like a \ntraditional textbook in order to ease the adoption process. To see examples of \nopen textbooks in a number of disciplines, visit OpenStax (licensed CC BY 4.0, \navailable at http://openstaxcollege.org/), the Open Textbook Library (licensed \nCC BY 4.0, available at https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/), or the BC Open \nTextbook Project (licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https://open.bccampus.ca/). \nOther times, OER are aggregated and presented as digital courseware. To see \nexamples of open courseware, visit the Open Education Consortium  (licensed \nCC BY 4.0, available at http://www.oeconsortium.org/courses/) and MIT Open -\nCourseWare (licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, available at https://ocw.mit.edu/index  \n.htm).\nIn addition to demonstrating that learners save money  when their teachers \nadopt OER, research shows that learners can have better  outcomes  when their \nteachers choose OER instead of educational materials that are available under \n\u201call rights reserved\u201d copyright.\nThe use of OER is strongly advocated by a broad range of individuals, organi -\nzations, and governments, as evidenced by documents like the Cape Town Open \nEducation Declaration (2007), the UNESCO Paris OER Declaration (2012), and \nthe recently adopted UNESCO Ljubljana OER Action Plan (2017).- 108 -  CHaPter 5\nOER vs. Free Library Resources\nTeachers and professors typically use a mix of \u201call rights reserved\u201d commer -\ncial content, free library resources, and OER in their courses. While the library \nresources are \u201cfree\u201d to the learners and faculty at that institution, they are (1) \nnot really \u201cfree\u201d because the institution\u2019s library had to pay to purchase or sub -\nscribe to them, and (2) they are not available to the general public. The chart in \nfigure 5.3 describes the cost to learners and the legal permissions available to \nteachers and learners for each of these types of educational resources.\nOER in Primary and Secondary (K\u221212) Education vs. Tertiary \n(Higher) Education\nOpen educational resources are used in all sectors of education. How OER are \nproduced and adopted, however, often differs depending on the level of educa -\ntion in which they are used. \nIn general, tertiary (higher education) faculty members are more likely to:\n\u2022 have the time, resources, and support to produce and revise educational \nresources;\n\u2022 own the copyright to the content they create (though this depends on \ntheir contract with the college or university); and\n\u2022 make unilateral decisions regarding what content is used in their \ncourses. \nAs such, higher education faculty are often OER producers and can decide \nwhether or not to adopt these OER in their courses. OER adoption in higher \neducation tends to occur one faculty member at a time. Given this opportunity , \nFIGURE 5.3   \nOER-Enabled Pedagogy, \nslide 16\nFigure available at https://\nwww.slideshare.net/  \nopencontent\nAuthor: David Wiley\nCC BY 4.0\nDesaturated from originalCreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 109 -\nit is critical that faculty members be given the time, resources, and support \nthey need in order to create and adopt open education content and undertake \na shift to open education practices and pedagogy. For an example of this sort \nof endeavor, see the open textbook Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care \nthat was written by faculty from British Columbia (licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://\nopentextbc.ca/clinicalskills/).\nIn general, primary and secondary (K\u221212) teachers are less likely to:\n\u2022 have the time, resources, and support to produce and revise educational \nresources;\n\u2022 own the copyright to the content they create (though this depends on \ntheir contract with the school or district); and\n\u2022 make unilateral decisions regarding what content is used in their  \ncurriculum. \nAs such, OER adoption in primary and secondary schools tends to occur at \nthe district or school level, rather than at the level of individual teachers.

These permissions also enable rapid, low-\ncost experimentation and innovation, as educators seek to maximize access to \neffective educational resources for all.\n5.4  |   FINDING, EVALUATING, AND ADAPTING RESOURCES\nWe live in a rich multimedia culture that requires educators to provide rele -\nvant learning resources in the classroom, although finding and reusing others\u2019 \ngreat works is not always simple. This section will teach you how to find others\u2019 \nOER and adapt them for use in your own classroom. CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 111 -\nLibrarians play an important role in the discovery , development, descrip -\ntion, licensing, curation, and sharing of Open Educational Resources. They also \nhave an opportunity to advocate for and support the use of these resources. \nThis section will also guide you through a practical approach to supporting the \nadoption of OER.\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nWhat skills and knowledge are needed to find just the right OER that you and \nyour learners need? If you are going to join the global Open Education commu -\nnity , find the best open resources for your course, and share your good work as \nan OER, you need to know\u2014and know how to teach others\u2014how to find, evalu -\nate, and adapt openly licensed resources. And what if we want to think bigger . . .  \nwhat effect might Open Education have globally?\nWhy is the openness of content\u2014the ability to revise, remix, and share it\u2014 so \nimportant? If the public had access to and could creatively remix the world\u2019s \nknowledge, what new opportunities might we find to address global challenges \n(e.g., the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals )?\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Find OER in open repositories, or by using Google, CC Search, or other \nplatforms\n\u2022 Evaluate how to reuse, revise, and remix the OER you find\n\u2022 Demonstrate how different OER can be used together, while paying \nattention to license compatibility\nFIGURE 5.4 Cell phone \nPhoto from Unsplash: \nhttps://unsplash.com/\nphotos/E1X0Oa77f5U \nAuthor: Tiago Aguiar \nPublic domain: CC0\nDestaurated from original- 112 -  CHaPter 5\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nWhere do you currently find your learning resources? Do you seek open alter -\nnatives for the materials you currently use? How do you evaluate your existing \nlearning resources, and how can you apply those measures to openly licensed \ncontent?\nOnce you identify the learning resources you currently use, ask yourself the \nfollowing questions:\n\u2022 Is this resource freely available to all of my learners?\n\u2022 Can my learners and I keep a copy of this resource forever?\n\u2022 Does my class have the legal rights to fix errors, update old or inaccurate \ncontent, improve the work, and share it with other educators around the \nworld?\n\u2022 Can my learners contribute to and improve our learning resources as \npart of their course work?\nIf the answer to these questions is \u201cNo, \u201d then you\u2019re probably using learning \nresources that don\u2019t provide the legal permissions you and your learners need \nto do what you want to do. Conversely , if you answered \u201cYes\u201d to all of the ques -\ntions, then you\u2019re probably using OER.\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nFINDING RESOURCES\nNot everything on the Internet is an open educational resource, and some \nworks labeled as \u201copen\u201d may not have the legal permissions to exercise the 5Rs. \nSo how do you recognize OER, and how do you choose which OER will work best \nin your class? \nFinding the resources you want to use is the first step to bringing OER into \nyour classroom. Discovery is one of the primary barriers for educators who \nwant to use OER. Fortunately , there are many established ways to search for \nthese resources.First, for a short introduction on how to find OER, watch the \nvideo How Can I Find OER? https://www.youtube.com/watch  \n?v=NJRIaQkiWKw   |  CC BY NC 4.0CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 113 -\nYou can do a quick review of OER projects and people on the OER World Map \n(licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://oerworldmap.org/) to get a sense of global OER \nactivities.\nThere are many websites that host large collections of OER (e.g., Wikimedia \nCommons), but some universities also host their own OER repositories and ser -\nvices. A good first step is to do a general OER search using Google Advanced \nSearch and filter your results by \u201cUsage Rights\u201d (on the pull-down menu at the \nbottom of the screen). See Google\u2019s post on how to use the tool effectively at \nhttps://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/find-creative-commons-images-with  \n-image.html.\nIn addition to sharing your OER on your website or blog, there are hundreds  \nof online platforms on which you can share your openly licensed content.  \nCreative Commons maintains a directory of some of the most popular platforms \nused by educators, organized by content type (photos, video, audio, textbooks, \ncourses, etc.) at https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/education  \n-oer/education-oer-resources/. You can also find OER on these platforms.\nWhen looking for OER, open educators often ask each other for help on Open \nEducation discussion lists. Here is a non-exhaustive tally of discussion lists you \nmight be interested in joining:\n\u2022 CC Open Education Platform  (invitation )\n\u2022 OER Forum\n\u2022 International OER Advocacy\n\u2022 OER Discuss\n\u2022 Open Knowledge Open Edu\n\u2022 Open Edu SIG\n\u2022 Wikimedia Education\n\u2022 US OER Advocacy\n\u2022 SPARC: Library OER\n\u2022 Educause Openness\nIf you want to know more about the most popular general options for search -\ning for OER, read the Open Washington course Module 6: Finding OER (licensed \nCC BY 4.0 at http://www.openwa.org/module-6-2/ ). \nCreative Commons redesigned its CC Search (figure 5.5).12 You can explore \nthe initial version of the new search engine (images only) at https://ccsearch  \n.creativecommons.org .

Educa -\ntors who are new to OER may have concerns about their quality because these \nresources are available for free and may have been remixed by other educators. \nBut the process of using and evaluating OER is not that different from evaluating \ntraditional \u201call rights reserved\u201d copyright resources. Whether education mate -\nrials are openly licensed or closed, you are the best judge of quality because you \nknow what your learners need and what your curriculum demands. \nSubject specialists (educators and librarians) assess the quality and suitabil -\nity of learning resources. The membership organization JISC provides a list of \ncriteria for the assessment of the quality of these resources. \n\u2022 Accuracy\n\u2022 Reputation of author/institution\n\u2022 Standard of technical production\n\u2022 Accessibility\n\u2022 Fitness for purpose13\nYou should be careful not to let anyone tell you that OER are \u201clow quality\u201d \nbecause they are free. As the SPARC OER Mythbusting Guide points out:\n\u2022 In this increasingly digital and Internet-connected world, the old adage \nthat \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d is growing outdated. New models are \ndeveloping across all aspects of society that dramatically reduce or elimi -\nnate costs to users, and this kind of innovation has spread to educational \nresources. \nFIGURE 5.5  CC SearchCreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 115 -\n\u2022 OER publishers have worked to ensure the quality of their resources. \nMany open textbooks are created within rigorous editorial and peer-  \nreview guidelines, and many OER repositories allow faculty to review \n(and see others\u2019 reviews of ) the material. There is also a growing body of \nevidence which demonstrates that OER can be both free of cost and high \nquality\u2014and more importantly , they can support positive student learn -\ning outcomes.14 \nAlso, be careful not to get pulled into a debate about high- or low-quality \neducational resources when what educators should really be concerned about \nis those resources\u2019 effectiveness. Read these two posts from David Wiley: \u201cStop \nSay  ing \u2018High Quality\u2019\u201d ( https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3821 ) and \u201cNo,  \nReally\u2014Stop Saying \u2018High Quality\u2019\u201d ( https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/  \n3830 ). \nRemixing and Adapting Resources\nBeing open enables educators to use the resource more effectively , which can \nlead to better learning and student outcomes. OER can be remixed, adapted, \nupdated, or tailored and improved locally to fit the needs of learners\u2014for exam -\nple, by translating the OER into a local language, adapting a biology open text -\nbook to align it with local science standards, or modifying an OER simulation to \nmake it accessible for a student who cannot hear.\nThe ideas of remixing and adaptation are fundamental to education. The cre -\native reuse of materials created by other educators and authors is about more \nthan just seeking inspiration; we copy , adapt, and combine different materials \nin order to craft appropriate and effective education resources for our learners.\nIncorporating materials created by others and combining materials from \ndifferent sources can be tricky , not only from a pedagogical perspective, but \nalso from a copyright perspective. \nOnline digital education resources have different legal permissions that \nempower (or not) the public to use, remix, and share those resources. Here are a \nfew of those legal categories:\n\u2022 Public domain works (which are not restricted by any copyright) can be \nremixed with any other work.\n \u00bbExample:  Anyone can remix The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by \nMark Twain with Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.\n\u2022 Some \u201call rights reserved\u201d copyrighted works are available for free \nonline, but you can only use them under the project terms of service,  - 116 -  CHaPter 5\nor by using an exception or limitation to copyright, such as fair use or \nfair dealing.\n \u00bbExample:  Many MOOCs allow free reuse of their content, but do not \nallow copying, revise, remix, or redistribution.\n\u2022 \u201cAll rights reserved\u201d copyrighted works in closed formats do not allow \nthe public to remix or adapt the work.\n \u00bbExample:  A blockbuster movie is usually available only on a \nstreaming service that you cannot use or even link to.\n\u2022 Creative Commons-licensed works (and other free licenses) are open, but \nthey may have various permissions and restrictions.\n \u00bbExample:  The online encyclopedia Wikipedia  (BY-SA) allows you \nto reuse its content for commercial purposes, while WikiHow \n(BY-NC-SA) does not. A Wikipedia  article cannot be remixed with a \nWikiHow article.\nIf you want to know which CC-licensed works can be remixed with other \nCC-licensed works, see figure 5.6, which repeats the CC remix chart  (figure 4.12) \nthat we studied in chapter 4. In this chart, where there is a check mark at the \nintersection of two CC-licensed works, you can remix those two works. Where \nthere is a black X, you cannot remix those two CC-licensed works. \nMARC Records and Metadata \nThere are metadata standards for OER that allow searchability , organization, \nand integration into current content systems at your institution. Metadata can \ninclude information such as author, title, subject area, grade level, keywords, \nand other categorical information. \nThere are many sources whereby you can easily include open textbooks in \nyour library collection. UnGlue.it has a comprehensive database of Creative \nCommons ebooks. In 2014 they added 1,897 free ebooks, and of these, 1,076 of \nthem have Creative Commons licenses.  Unglue.it has also added librarian tools \n(https://unglue.it/accounts/edit/marc_config/ ) to allow users to download and \nupload customizable MARC (machine-readable cataloging) records. As free, \nopenly licensed resources, OER often live outside of the catalog, and catalog -\ning standards can differ between repositories. You can check out the WorldCat \ncatalog record for OpenStax to see what an OER might look like in the catalog CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 117 -\n(https://www.worldcat.org/title/openstax/oclc/824454682). How do you cata -\nlog OER? If you\u2019re participating in the CC Certificate course, use the class chat \nto discuss this question.\nThe Open Textbook Library and BC Campus also provide MARC biblio-  \ngraphic records for OER. The Open Textbook Library also uses CC0 for all of its \nMARC records. You can read more about how to use CC for MARC records at \nhttp://dltj.org/article/cc0-marc-records/.\nFinal Remarks\nWe live in an amazing world of information abundance, and an increasing per -\ncentage of our digital knowledge is openly licensed. But finding the right open \nresources that fit the needs of your learning spaces and your learners can be a \nchallenge. One of the major motivations for using OER is the ability to revise, \nremix, and share these works in ways that will best suit the needs of your learn -\ners. Search engines, OER repositories, and platform services with built-in tools \nfor using Creative Commons licenses help, but finding the right OER can still \ntake time for your faculty and library patrons to accomplish.\nFIGURE 5.6 CC License Compatibility Chart\nFigure from Creative Commons: https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-combine-material  \n-under-different-creative-commons-licenses-in-my-work\nCC BY 4.0  |  Desaturated from original- 118 -  CHaPter 5\n5.5  |   CREATING AND SHARING OER\nLarge parts of this book are about creation, both how it works from a legal per -\nspective and, more practically , how we learn by making and creating something. \nIn this section we will explore and practice how to create and share OER so they \ncan have the biggest impact and be used without any legal or technical barriers.\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nA big part of any educator\u2019s work is preparing, updating, and combining learn -\ning materials. Making those materials open requires just a few additional steps, \nand it\u2019s easier than you think. What are those steps? What should you consider \nand expect when you want to create and publish your resources in the open?\nWhen we share our education resources as OER, we share our best practices, \nour expertise, our challenges and solutions. Education is about sharing. And \nwhen we share our work with more people, we become better educators.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Imagine how your OER will work in practice\n\u2022 Understand how to select CC licenses for your resources\n\u2022 Examine your open license decision for compatibility (i.e., can it  \nbe remixed) with other OER\n\u2022 Identify the needs and challenges to improving OER accessibility  \nfor everyone\nPersonal Reflection: Why It Matters To You\nWhat kind of learning resources do you create now? Do you publish or share \nthese resources with other people for feedback? Which of your resources do \nyou think could benefit fellow educators, learners, researchers, and libraries? \nIf you choose to share, how much freedom do you want to give to others; in other \nwords, what permissions will you allow for others to reuse your work?\nFor an introduction on why it is important to share your work \nas an OER, watch the video Open Education Matters: Why \nIs It Important to Share Content?  https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=dTNnxPcY49Q   |  CC BY 3.0CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 119 -\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge\nWHY SHARE? \nBecause educators and librarians can share OER with everyone for near zero \ncost,15 we should do this. After all, education is fundamentally about sharing \nknowledge and ideas. Libraries are about archiving, sharing, and helping learn -\ners to find the knowledge they seek. When we CC-license our work, we are shar -\ning that work with the public under simple, legal permissions. Sharing your \nwork is a gift to the world.\nCHOOSING A CC LICENSE FOR OER\nAs you may remember, not all educational materials that are available under a \nCC license are OER. Review the chart in figure 5.7 that details which CC licenses \nwork well for education resources and which do not.\nThe two CC NoDerivatives (ND) licenses are not OER-compatible licenses \nbecause they don\u2019t allow the public to revise or remix the educational resource. \nBecause the ND licenses do not meet the 5Rs or any of the major OER defini -\ntions, the Open Education movement does not consider ND-licensed educa -\ntional resources to be \u201c OER. \u201d\nFIGURE 5.7  Which CC licenses work well for education resources and which do not- 120 -  CHaPter 5\nChoosing the right license for your OER requires you to think about which \npermissions you want to give to other users\u2014and which permissions you want \nto retain for yourself. Read the statement \u201cOpen Textbook Community Advo -\ncates CC BY License for Open Textbooks\u201d  (licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://open  \n.bccampus.ca/2016/11/04/open-textbook-community-advocates-cc-by-license  \n-for-open-textbooks/ ) and think about why they recommend the Creative Com -\nmons Attribution license (CC BY) for education. You can find more arguments \nmade about the utility of this same license for publishing scientific research in \nthe article \u201cWhy CC BY?\u201d from the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Associa -\ntion (licensed CC BY 4.0 at https://oaspa.org/why-cc-by/).\nFor basic information about the licenses, and how to choose and apply one to \nyour work or to combined works from other people and sources, revisit section \n4.1 \u201cChoosing and Applying a CC License. \u201d \nCC LICENSE LEGAL CASES IN OPEN EDUCATION\nFor a detailed analysis of Creative Commons case law, see section 3.4 \u201cLicense \nEnforceability . \u201d Creative Commons maintains a listing of court decisions and \ncase law from jurisdictions around the world on its wiki , licensed CC BY 4.0 at \nhttps://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Law . \nIn 2017\u221218 there were two legal cases concerning Open Education: Great \nMinds vs. FedEx Office  and Great Minds vs. Office Depot , as referenced in chapter \n4. As a reminder, both cases involved OER used by schools for non-commercial \npurposes. In both cases, the district courts found that a commercial copy shop \nmay reproduce educational materials at the request of a school district that is \nusing them under a CC BY-NC-SA license; thus, no license copyright infringe -\nment or violation of the CC license had occurred.\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\nOther than choosing the right CC license, what other aspects of openness \nand pedagogy are worth considering? You can read a list of best practices to \ninclude in your work when building OER at https://maricopa.instructure.com/\ncourses/805732/pages/educational-best-practices?module_item_id=5139807 . \nWatch the video Simply Said: Understanding Accessibility in Digi tal \nLearning Materials  by the National Center on Accessible Educa -\ntional Materials. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzE5dj1WTSoCreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 121 -\nThe Open Washington network\u2019s Module 8 on \u201cSharing OER\u201d (licensed CC \nBY 4.0, available at http://www.openwa.org/module-8/) will give you practical \nadvice on how to share OER online and prepare them to be used offline as well. \nENSURING THAT OER ARE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE\nAt its core, OER are about making sure that everyone has access to learning and \nresearch materials. Not just rich people, not just people who can see or hear, not \njust people who can read English\u2014everyone.\nAs authors and institutions build and share OER, best practices in accessi -\nbility need to be part of their instructional and technical design from the start. \nEducators have legal and ethical responsibilities to ensure that our learning \nresources are fully accessible to all learners, including those with disabilities.\nThe best practices to ensure that your OER are accessible to all include:\n\u2022 putting your work into the public domain (CC0) or adding a non-ND CC \nlicense to your work;\n\u2022 making it simple to download your work in editable file formats, so others \ncan modify or translate it to meet local needs and make it accessible; and\n\u2022 most importantly , designing your work to be accessible from the start.\nFIGURE 5.8  Print encyclopedia and e-book reader on green grass\nPhoto from Pixabay: https://pixabay.com/en/e-reader-e-book-ebook-e-ink-1213214/\nAuthor: papirontul   |  Public Domain: CC0  |  Cropped and desaturated from original- 122 -  CHaPter 5\nLIBRARY WEBSITES, LIBRARY SUBJECT GUIDES, CATALOGING,  \nAND CREATIVE COMMONS\nLibrarians who find themselves in the role of content creators may wonder \nhow to license their work. Over 5,000 institutions in the United States use \nLibGuides as their preferred subject guide content management system, with \nover 120,000 license holders around the world. Licensing your resources under \nCreative Commons can be as simple as using the license chooser to create a \nmachine-readable icon for your site or LibGuide. \nThere are hundreds of LibGuides on library websites about Creative Com -\nmons alone. Use Google to search for LibGuides about Creative Commons and \nflip through the resources found by subject librarians on the issues of Creative \nCommons and copyright.\nFinal Remarks\nOpenness in education means more than just access or legal certainty over \nwhat you are able to use, modify , and share with your learners. Open Educa -\ntion means designing content and practices which will ensure that everyone \ncan actively participate and contribute to the sum of all human knowledge. As \neducators and learners revise others\u2019 OER and create and share new OER, acces -\nsibility should always be on your design checklist.\n5.6  |   OPENING UP YOUR INSTITUTION\nThis section discusses how educational institutions can support open educa -\ntion content, practices, and community with policy .\nTHE BIG QUESTION: WHY IT MATTERS\nEducational institutions around the world are trying to figure out how to sup -\nport their educators, staff, and learners in using, revising, and sharing OER in \nthe context of new Open Education practices. How can educational leaders use \nvarious policy tools to support and promote Open Education?\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\n\u2022 Consider if and why you need a policy to accomplish your Open  \nEducation goals\n\u2022 Understand the menu of Open Education policy options\n\u2022 Assess your existing institutional policies\n\u2022  Understand how to develop an institutional open policyCreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 123 -\nPERSONAL REFLECTION: WHY IT MATTERS TO YOU\nWhat if there were institutional policies that supported your Open Education \nand open access efforts? What effect might pro-Open Access and pro-Open  \nEducation policies have on you and your learners?\nAcquiring Essential Knowledge  \nEducational institutions have a broad menu of Open Education policy options \nfrom which to choose. Your institution can:\n\u2022 Raise awareness of the existence of OER and their benefits for your learn -\ners and faculty . \n \u00bbAction: Host an annual \u201cOpen Education\u201d day at your school or uni -\nversity .\n\u2022 Empower stakeholders to drive your institution\u2019s Open Education strategy.\n \u00bbAction: Create an Open Education Task Force comprised of learners, \nfaculty , accessibility experts, deans, bookstore, financial aid, and \nlibrary staff, instructional designers, eLearning, and so on.\n\u2022 Ensure that all of the content you fund is OER.\n \u00bbAction: Draft, adopt, and implement an open licensing policy \nrequiring university or school-funded resources to be openly \nlicensed (preferably CC BY 4.0). Use the OER Policy Development \nTool (licensed CC BY 4.0, available at http://policy .lumenlearning  \n.com/ ) to build an open policy for your institution. You can find \nexamples of open policies that others have created at the OER  \nPolicy Registry (global; licensed CC BY 4.0, available at https://  \nwiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/OER_Policy_Registry) and SPARC\u2019s \n\u201cList of North American OER Policies and Projects \u201d (licensed CC \nBY 4.0, available at https://sparcopen.org/our-work/list-of-oer  \n-policies-projects/ ).\n\u2022 Issue a call-to-action to solve an educational challenge.\n \u00bbAction:  Create an OER grant program. You could appropriate funds \nfor supporting faculty and staff to shift your fifty highest-enrolled \ncourses from closed content to OER.\nExample:  The Maricopa County Community College started an \nopen textbook initiative to lower the costs of teaching materials. \nThey provided grants to create open courses and train faculty \non OER. You can learn more about their process at https://  \nmaricopa.instructure.com/courses/811971.- 124 -  CHaPter 5\n\u2022 Leverage existing strategic documents to support Open Education.\n \u00bbAction: Add Open Education goals to your institution\u2019s key strategy \ndocuments.\n \u00bbAction: Identify and track key performance indicators that improve \nwhen courses and/or degrees adopt OER.\nExample:  Increasing student outcomes, increasing the per -\ncentage of learners who can access 100 percent of the learning \nresources on day 1, reducing dropouts during add/drop periods, \nincreasing credits taken per semester, decreasing student debt, \ndecreasing time to degree.\n\u2022 Make it easy to share OER.\n \u00bbAction:  Join a global OER repository and make it simple for your \neducators and learners to find others\u2019 OER and share their own OER. \nProvide professional development.\n\u2022 Ensure that educators have the legal rights to share.\n \u00bbAction: Change the contract between the institution and the fac -\nulty or teachers so that these educators have the legal rights to CC-  \nlicense their work.\nExample:  A Creative Commons policy in New Zealand gives \nteachers advance permission to disseminate their resources \nonline for sharing and reuse. The policy also ensures that both \nthe school and the teacher\u2014as well as teachers from around the \ncountry and around the world\u2014can continue to use and adapt \nresources produced by New Zealand teachers in the course of \ntheir employment. Creative Commons NZ has developed an \nannotated policy template for schools to adapt (http://resources  \n.creativecommons.org.nz/cc-schools-policy/). \n\u2022 Provide OER information to learners.\n \u00bbAction: Require OER Course designations in course catalogs so \nlearners can see whether (or not) a course uses an OER or an open \ntextbook. \nExample:  The City University of New York labels OER in its cata-  \nlog; see the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRjTRza_I18  \n&feature=youtu.be .CreatIve Commons for LIbrarI ans and ed UCators  - 125 -\n\u2022 Reward sharing.\n \u00bbAction: Adjust promotion and tenure policies to reward the creation, \nadoption, and maintenance of OER and publishing in Open Access \njournals. The creation and adaptation of OER should be appropri -\nately recognized as curricular innovation and service to the aca -\ndemic profession during promotion and tenure review.\nENFORCING OPEN EDUCATION AND OPEN ACCESS POLICIES\nThe point of most Open Education and Open Access policies is to ensure that \npublicly (or foundation) funded education and research resources (1) can be \nread by everyone, (2) are openly licensed, and (3) are shared in editable file for -\nmats in public repositories, with a zero embargo period, which provides imme -\ndiate public access upon publication. Creative Commons often uses the catch -\nphrase \u201cpublicly funded resources should be openly licensed resources\u2014the \npublic should have access to what it funds. \u201d When it comes to enforcing Open \nEducation and Open Access policies, multiple people and institutions play \nimportant roles.\u00a0\nGovernment, foundation, and institutional funders and program officers \nresponsible for managing grants and contracts need to (1) understand their \nOpen Education/Access policies, (2) communicate the importance of these poli -\ncies to grantees verbally and in writing, and (3) check to ensure that the public \nhas full access to the openly licensed resources, research, and data under the \nterms of the Open Education and Open Access policy .\nUniversity or college administration should provide support (e.g., by hiring \na full-time OA or OER librarian) to faculty who are publishing in Open Access \njournals or otherwise sharing their research openly and to faculty who are \ncreating, remixing, sharing, and adopting OER. Institutions should also review \nand modify (as needed) promotion and tenure policies to ensure that faculty \nwho are engaged in Open Education and Open Access publishing are rewarded \nduring promotion and tenure review.16\nFinal Remarks\nWhen educational institutions support their educators, staff, and learners in \nmoving from closed to open content and practices, Open Education thrives. \nEducators want to design the best courses, adjust their practices and pedagogy \nto empower learners to co-create knowledge, and push the limits of knowledge - 126 -  CHaPter 5\nby openly sharing their ideas and resources with a global audience. But educa -\ntors can\u2019t do it alone. They need political, financial, time, staff, and policy sup -\nport to shift to, and fully realize, the benefits of Open Education.\n5.7  |   ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nMore Background on Open Access\n\u2022 \u201cA Very Brief Introduction to Open Access, \u201d by Peter Suber. \nThis is a short description defining Open Access, research articles, \nOpen Access repositories, archives, and journals: http://api.ning.com/\nfiles/JOi7zGa2fuzuS*bGstF4DkFDsquoaB8W AHtxNzkKpmGEJcUtvb  \nArAaUG56hLkiZaT3jSnZf354VW573zjj25qhlUnRcN6POA/Averybrief  \nintroductiontoOpenAccessA4.pdf .\n\u2022 \u201cOpen Access Overview, \u201d by the University of Minnesota Libraries. \nThis is an introduction to Open Access, and specifically how it pertains \nto librarians.
